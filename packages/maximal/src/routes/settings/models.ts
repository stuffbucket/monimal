/**
 * /settings/api/models — read-only view of the cached model catalog,
 * plus a manual refresh.
 *
 * The catalog itself is fetched from Copilot's `/models` at boot and
 * refreshed lazily on activity (src/lib/refresh-models.ts). That timer
 * is a freshness *optimization*, not a correctness guarantee — its
 * clock-start is uncorrelated with when Copilot actually changes the
 * list. So this route also exposes `POST /refresh`, which forces a
 * `cacheModels()` now and returns the fresh list. The UI surfaces the
 * cache's age next to that button so staleness is visible and
 * actionable rather than silent.
 *
 * Auth-gated by the parent `/settings/api` middleware. This route only
 * reads `state.models` (already filtered to model_picker_enabled ||
 * embeddings by cacheModels) — it never exposes tokens.
