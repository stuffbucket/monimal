/**
 * Settings event bus (ADR-0007) — the producer side of the shell's live
 * update channel. Replaces the shell's per-section poll loops: instead of
 * the Tauri webview re-fetching `/settings/api/*` every couple of seconds,
 * the sidecar pushes a typed event the instant observable state changes and
 * the shell renders it.
 *
 * This module is intentionally tiny and dependency-light (only the generic
 * EventBus + the wire types) so producers across the codebase can publish
 * without importing the consumer or the shell. The `LiveFeedHub`
 * (src/lib/ws/live-feed.ts) subscribes here and fans each event out to every
 * connected tab over the unified WebSocket (ADR-0019, which supersedes the
 * original SSE route this bus once fed).
 *
 * Initial scope is `auth.changed` (the sign-in smoothness win). The map is
 * shaped to grow — accounts.changed, apps.changed, clients.changed,
 * upstream.rejection, boot.state — per ADR-0007's event list, each payload
 * being the same shape its corresponding GET endpoint returns.

 * changes mid-session (that field rides on the auth status). A direct
 * `state → auth-controller` import would be a cycle, so instead the
 * controller registers its projector here at module load, and ANY producer
 * (the controller's own transitions, or state.ts on a rejection change)
 * calls `emitAuthChanged()` to publish the current snapshot.

 * No-op until the projector is registered (e.g. a rejection recorded before

 * model as `last_upstream_rejection`), so recovery from a long outage rides a
 * single event with `notify_on_reconnect: true` and the shell fires the toast.
 *
 * The flag lives ONLY on this emitted event — `getAuthStatus()` (and thus the
 * GET endpoint + every other `auth.changed`) never carries it, so steady state
 * and the initial SSE snapshot stay clean and the shell can't re-fire on a
