/**
 * Shutdown plumbing: SIGTERM / SIGINT handlers + an `exit`-event
 * safety-net reverter + optional parent-death watchdog. Tauri spawns
 * the sidecar with MAXIMAL_SIDECAR_PARENT_PID so the sidecar self-
 * terminates if the shell crashes without sending SIGTERM. Drain
 * order, including the Claude Code revert step, is documented inline
 * in initiateShutdown().
 *
 * Coverage matrix for the Claude Code base-URL revert:
 *   - SIGTERM / SIGINT          → initiateShutdown ✓
 *   - process.exit(n) anywhere  → `exit` event safety net ✓
 *   - uncaught exception        → `exit` event safety net ✓
 *   - Tauri parent died         → parent-pid watchdog → initiateShutdown ✓
 *   - SIGKILL / OS-level kill   → ✗ no userspace runs. Sentinel-based
 *                                  warning on next boot (run-server.ts)
 *                                  diagnoses but can't auto-recover.
