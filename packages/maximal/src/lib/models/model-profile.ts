/**
 * ModelProfile — the single resolved record of "the truth about a model."
 *
 * maximal performs on-the-fly compensation over a default behavior for each
 * model (see ADR-0016, docs/spec/model-protocol-strategy.md). Historically that
 * compensation was expressed as per-model conditionals scattered across the
 * transform sites — each pass reaching into `model.capabilities.supports.*`
 * with its own predicate, plus hardcoded `if (model.id === "…")` literals welded
 * into individual passes. Cyclomatic complexity accumulated monotonically: every
 * new model added branches in several places, and nothing garbage-collected the
 * old ones.
 *
 * This resolver is the seam that bounds that growth. A transform asks for the
 * resolved profile ONCE and branches on DATA (profile.isReasoning) instead of
 * MODEL IDENTITY (model.id === "gpt-5.6-sol"). A brand-new model is then handled
 * by default — it inherits behavior from its catalog capabilities — so onboarding
 * becomes a config/data edit rather than another `if`.
 *
 * SCOPE: this holds INTRINSIC, catalog-derived facts (the `base_model` analog in
 * models.dev terms). Authored per-model tuning (extra prompts, reasoning-effort
 * overrides, responses context-management) still lives behind the config
 * accessors and is being consolidated separately (#336, parked — see
 * docs/decisions/0022-per-model-tuning-consolidation-parked.md); once that
 * lands, the resolved tuning merges in here too, completing the ModelProfile
 * picture (#338).
 *
 * CANDIDATES TO ABSORB NEXT — the per-model literal branches this resolver is
 * meant to replace, each becoming a labeled profile field instead of inline
 * logic in a transform:
 *   - `blocksChatCompletions` — chat-completions/handler.ts (`id === "gpt-5.4"`);
 *     ideally derived from `supported_endpoints`, not a literal.
 *   - `forcesSummarizedThinking` — preprocess.ts (`model === "claude-opus-4.7"`).
 *   - `skipsProxyHeaderInjection` — create-messages.ts
 *     (`startsWith("claude-opus-4.8")` WAF quirk).
