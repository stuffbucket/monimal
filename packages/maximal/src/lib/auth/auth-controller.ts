/**
 * In-memory state machine for the GitHub device-code auth flow,
 * driven on-demand by the Settings UI via /settings/api/auth/github/*.
 *
 * Distinct from `src/lib/token.ts`'s `setupGitHubToken`, which is the
 * legacy boot-time path: it opens the browser, copies to clipboard,
 * and blocks the calling promise until the poll completes. The
 * controller below does none of those — it returns immediately,
 * exposes the user_code/verification_uri to the client, and runs a
 * non-blocking poller in the background. The shell renders whatever
 * UI it likes with that data; nothing here decides for it.
 *
 * State model (boundary D3): the controller holds ONE `AuthState`
 * discriminated union — the set of representable states equals the set
 * of valid states. `getAuthStatus()` is an exhaustive switch over it,
 * not a reconstruction from independent nullables. Phase 3 will add a
 * single `transition(state, event)` reducer + effect-runner on top of
 * this; for now the writers below set the union directly.

 *
 * Single-flight guarantee: at most one poller runs at any moment.
 * Calling startDeviceFlow() while a non-expired flow is active is
 * idempotent — same code returned, no second poller spawned.
