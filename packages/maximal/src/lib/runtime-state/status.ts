/**
 * The `/status` payload — a small, unauthenticated identity + liveness
 * report for the whole proxy.
 *
 * Schema shape (deliberately layered so it grows without churn):
 *
 *   - TOP LEVEL is "Maximal, all up": the fields that describe the proxy
 *     process itself. The mere presence of a well-formed response (with
 *     `service: "maximal"`) is the identity signal — that's what the
 *     Claude Code shim keys off, and it's stable forever.
 *
 *   - `subsystems` namespaces everything else by the part of Maximal it
 *     describes. Each subsystem is its own object. As we add subsystems
 *     (more providers, the shell, background jobs, …) they get a new key
 *     here — callers that don't know about them simply ignore the key,
 *     and existing keys never have to be reshaped. This is the seam that
 *     keeps `/status` from becoming a flat hand-rolled grab-bag.
 *
 * Everything here is SAFE to expose unauthenticated on loopback: booleans
 * and tiers and counts, never token values, account logins, PIDs, or any
 * PII. Sensitive/granular diagnostics stay behind auth
 * (`/settings/api/diagnostics`) or the verbose-gated `/_debug/state`.
 *
 * Platform-neutral by construction — nothing here is macOS-specific, so
 * the same contract holds on Windows and Linux.
