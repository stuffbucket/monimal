# Maximal's PRODUCER for the stuffbucket/macos-builder pipeline.
#
# Builds the signed Electron client (client/) into an .app and leaves it at the
# config's `app_path`:
#   client/out/Maximal-darwin-arm64/Maximal.app
#
# It does NOT build a dmg/pkg, notarize, staple, or write OUTPUT_DIR — the builder
# owns that tail (lib/package-macos.sh: top-level sign without --deep → package →
# notarize → staple → checksum). The producer is never handed APPLE_* or
# KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD.
#
# Unlike a Tauri app (one main binary + sidecar), an Electron .app contains nested
# Helper apps + the Electron Framework, which MUST be signed inside-out. The
# builder's later top-level sign alone cannot do that, so this producer performs
# the full inside-out sign here via @electron/osx-sign (driven by electron-forge
# `package`, gated on SIGN_IDENTITY in forge.config.ts). The builder's top-level
# re-sign then just re-seals the outer bundle (no --deep, idempotent). The
# compiled sidecar's invalid linker ad-hoc signature is stripped before packaging;
# @electron/osx-sign then signs the copy inside the final app exactly once, with
# the same hardened-runtime/JIT profile as every other nested executable.
#
# Builder-supplied env consumed: TAG, ARCH, SIGN_IDENTITY, ENTITLEMENTS_DIR,
# BUN_INSTALL, CARGO_HOME. The keychain is already unlocked — do not unlock it.

# Self-hosted runners use non-login shells that don't read ~/.zshrc.
