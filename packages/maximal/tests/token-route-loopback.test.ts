/**
 * Regression guard for security defect #230.
 *
 * `GET /token` used to return the RAW upstream Copilot secret
 * (`{ token: state.copilotToken }`). It had zero legitimate consumers
 * anywhere in the repo and was inherited verbatim from the vendored
 * upstream fork, so the fix DELETED the route rather than gating it —
 * a deleted route can't leak the secret to anyone.
 *
 * The load-bearing assertion here is that an AUTHENTICATED,
 * NON-LOOPBACK caller (a remote holder of a valid API key) can NOT
 * read the secret: the route is gone, so the request 404s. Merely
 * adding `/token` to `loopbackOnlyPaths` would NOT have blocked such a
 * caller (that list only *relaxes* auth for loopback callers — see
 * src/lib/request-auth.ts), which is why deletion is the correct fix.
 *
 * In-process `server.request(...)` carries no socket, so
 * `defaultGetRequestIp` resolves to null → the caller is treated as
 * non-loopback. We authenticate via `state.shellApiKey`, whose
 * presented key bypasses the enforce flag in the auth middleware.
