/**
 * THE gate to prove first (spec §1.3, §10 "WS real-port handshake"): the
 * `/ws` handler's return after `server.upgrade()` must pass through Hono + srvx
 * + Bun so a genuine WebSocket connects. This is the ONE deliberate real-port
 * test in the suite (every other test uses Hono's in-memory `app.request()` —
 * the repo binds no ports): `serve({ port: 0, bun: { websocket } })` gets an
 * ephemeral port and opens a real socket against it.
 *
 * Note the return VALUE is guarded separately, in `ws-upgrade-return.test.ts`:
 * Bun hijacks the socket during `server.upgrade()`, so this handshake opens
 * even if Hono then chokes finalizing the return — the coercion of a bare
 * `undefined` to status 0 (RangeError) is post-hoc and doesn't reach this
 * client. That sibling unit test asserts the handler returns a real `101`.
 *
 * It used to conflict with `start-run-server.test.ts`, which mocked srvx via
 * `mock.module("srvx", …)` (a stub that forward-leaks across files per
 * CLAUDE.md and left the live `serve` binding half-rewired). That test now
 * injects its serve stub through a module-local DI seam (`__setServeForTests`)
 * instead of mocking srvx, so the real srvx reaches this file and the two
 * co-run cleanly. Ungating is guarded by the mockModuleLeakGuard eslint rule,
 * which forbids re-introducing `mock.module("srvx", …)`.
