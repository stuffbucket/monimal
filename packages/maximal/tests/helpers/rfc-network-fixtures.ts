/**
 * Standards-backed network fixtures for the network-diagnostics tests.
 *
 * Real third-party hostnames and IPs drift — they can start or stop resolving,
 * get firewalled, or change routing — which makes any test that hard-codes them
 * flaky. The IETF reserves specific names and address blocks *precisely* so
 * documentation and test code have stable, guaranteed-behavior values. We use
 * those here, each tied to the RFC that guarantees its behavior, so:
 *
 *   - the deterministic (default) suite injects that behavior through the probe
 *     DI seam and reads like the live network, and
 *   - the opt-in real-network suite dials the very same fixtures and verifies
 *     the live probes actually observe the RFC-guaranteed outcome.
 *
 * References:
 *   - RFC 5737 — IPv4 Address Blocks Reserved for Documentation (TEST-NET-1/2/3)
 *   - RFC 3849 — IPv6 Address Prefix Reserved for Documentation (2001:DB8::/32)
 *   - RFC 2606 — Reserved Top Level DNS Names (`example.com`, `.invalid`, …)
 *   - RFC 6761 — Special-Use Domain Names (formalizes `.invalid` as NXDOMAIN)
