# PRD: First-Run Setup Detection & GUI Setup Flow

## Problem

Maximal's setup story is CLI-shaped: `maximal auth` runs an interactive device-code flow, prints a code, copies it to the clipboard, polls until the user approves. That works because there's a terminal.

When a user installs maximal from a `.dmg` and launches it from `/Applications`, **there is no terminal**. The Tauri shell starts the sidecar (`maximal start --port 4142`), the tray icon appears, the user clicks "Open Maximal" — and gets a dashboard pointed at a proxy that may have:

- no GitHub token → every Copilot request 401s
- no `~/.local/share/maximal/` dir → file writes fail with EACCES/ENOENT
- a stale or invalid `config.json` → server may have refused to boot

None of these are surfaced as actionable UI. The proxy may just be silently broken.

This PRD covers detection on every launch, a machine-readable status surface, and a GUI flow for executing the remaining setup steps without a terminal.

## Goals

- On every launch (CLI or shell), maximal knows whether it is ready to serve.
- The Tauri shell can ask one HTTP question to find out, and renders a setup window if anything is missing.
- The GUI setup flow uses the existing device-code OAuth — no new auth path, no browser-bound callbacks.
- CLI behavior unchanged: `maximal auth` and `maximal start` keep their existing prompts and exits.

## Non-Goals

- Provider keys (Anthropic, OpenAI). Surfaced read-only in Settings later; not part of first-run.
- Browser-redirect OAuth. Device-code already works everywhere; redirect flow adds attack surface (open ports, callback routing) for no UX gain on a desktop app.
- Online updater / first-launch migration UI. The existing path-rename auto-migration handles the only known migration.

## Setup State Machine

A "setup check" is a named boolean with a reason string when false. The proxy exposes the aggregate via `GET /setup-status`:

```json
{
  "ready": false,
  "checks": {
    "appDir":     { "ok": true,  "path": "~/.local/share/maximal" },
    "config":     { "ok": true,  "path": "~/.local/share/maximal/config.json" },
    "db":         { "ok": true,  "path": "~/.local/share/maximal/copilot-api.sqlite" },
    "githubAuth": { "ok": false, "reason": "github_token missing" }
  },
  "nextStep": "github_auth"
}
```

| Check        | Pass condition                                                                                       |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `appDir`     | `~/.local/share/maximal` (or `$COPILOT_API_HOME`) exists, writable.                                  |
| `config`     | `config.json` either absent OR parses through the zod `AppConfig` schema. Empty = OK = defaults.     |
| `db`         | `copilot-api.sqlite` opens, is on the current schema (migrations not pending).                       |
| `githubAuth` | `github_token` file present, non-empty, validates against Copilot's token-introspection endpoint.    |

`ready = all(ok)`. `nextStep` is the first failing check in canonical order (`appDir` → `config` → `db` → `githubAuth`), or `null` when ready.

The endpoint is **unauthenticated** — same posture as `/` and `/ui/*`. It must work *before* any API key has been issued.

## Detection

### Where checks happen

- **At process start** (`src/main.ts` `start` command): existing path-creation + token-load logic is already most of this. Surface results to the trace log; do not exit on missing-auth (the GUI needs the proxy alive to call `/setup-status`).
- **At `/setup-status` request time**: cheap re-evaluation each call; ms-scale, no caching needed.

### What changes in the proxy

- New module: `src/lib/setup-status.ts`. Pure function `evaluateSetup(): SetupStatus`, no I/O hiding. Composed of per-check helpers already implemented in `src/lib/paths.ts`, `src/lib/config.ts`, `src/lib/github-token-store.ts`.
- New route: `GET /setup-status` (handler under `src/routes/setup-status.ts`). Bypasses `createAuthMiddleware`.
- Boot path: `src/server.ts` registers the route before the auth middleware so it's reachable when no API key is configured.

### What does NOT change

- `maximal auth` and `maximal start` exit codes and prompts.
- Existing auth tests.
- The `/_debug/state` surface (kept; complementary, deeper).

## GUI Execution

> **Revised against `.design-context.md` and the design-onboard skill.**
> The earlier "four cards in canonical order" model leaked the backend
> mental model into the UI. Only `githubAuth` requires human action;
> the others self-heal or block as exceptional errors. The flow below
> is **one primary action, three states**, optimized for time-to-aha.

### What the user is actually trying to do

A developer on macOS installed maximal from a `.dmg` because they
want to route their AI tooling (Claude Code, Cursor, an SDK script,
opencode) through their existing GitHub Copilot subscription. The
**aha moment** is not "I am signed in" — it is **"my client made a
request and got a response through maximal."** Setup's job is to
remove the only barrier between launch and that moment, then bridge
into the surface where it actually happens (the Dashboard's
Connect + Activity sections).

### Detection on shell launch

The Tauri shell spawns the sidecar at launch and polls
`GET http://localhost:4142/setup-status`, retrying for ~5 seconds
while the sidecar binds.

- **`ready: true`** — tray + dashboard behave as normal.
- **`ready: false` with `nextStep === "githubAuth"`** (the only
  expected pre-setup state in practice) — tray shows a quiet badge,
  the dashboard menu item subtitles "Setup required," and any
  click into the app opens the Setup window.
- **`ready: false` with `nextStep === "appDir" | "config" | "db"`**
  — exceptional. The Setup window's normal welcome content swaps
  for an inline error block (see Failure Modes below). These are
  blockers, not onboarding steps; treating them as cards in a flow
  conflates "the proxy can't run" with "you haven't signed in yet."

### Setup window — three states, one window

A single Tauri webview at `http://localhost:4142/setup`, served from
`shell/src/setup/` (Vite bundle). 520×620 default. Single column,
content max 440px, centered vertically. **No sidebar, no card
nesting, no "step X of N" indicator** — there is one step.

The window has three mutually exclusive states driven by the
device-code lifecycle plus `/setup-status`. The window does not
navigate between routes; it swaps content with a 200ms opacity
crossfade (instant when `prefers-reduced-motion`).

#### State 1 — Welcome (default for an unauthed first launch)

```
                  [brand m]

           Welcome to Maximal

   Route Claude Code, Cursor, or any Anthropic-
   or OpenAI-compatible client through your
   GitHub Copilot subscription.

   Two minutes to set up.


   ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
   │   Sign in with GitHub      →     │   ← primary, single CTA
   └──────────────────────────────────┘


   Already signed in via the CLI?
   Maximal will pick up the existing token —
   close this window and reopen.
```

Notes:
- **Display heading** uses the Fraunces serif (one humanist accent
  per the design-context). Body is Commissioner (per the typeset
  pairing).
- **Honest time estimate** ("two minutes") instead of "Get started"
  — respects user intelligence per the onboarding skill.
- **Rescue path for CLI migrants** is the second-most-important
  thing on the screen, but explicitly secondary type. Someone who
  installed via Homebrew + CLI auth can close the window and skip
  setup entirely; we want them to feel they're already done.
- **No "Skip" button** — there's nothing else to do. Skipping setup
  is closing the window.
- **No telemetry copy, no "By signing in you agree to..."** — the
  agreement is between the user and GitHub, not us.

#### State 2 — Waiting for GitHub approval

Triggered when the user clicks "Sign in with GitHub":

1. Setup page POSTs `/auth/start`. Proxy calls GitHub's device-code
   endpoint via existing `setupGitHubToken` logic, returns
   `{ verification_uri, verification_uri_complete?, user_code,
   expires_in, interval }`.
2. Proxy writes `user_code` to the OS clipboard (already done in
   `src/lib/token.ts:165`).
3. Setup page calls Tauri's `opener::open_url(...)` for
   `verification_uri_complete ?? verification_uri`.
4. Setup page transitions to State 2 and starts polling `/auth/poll`
   every `interval` seconds.

```
                  [brand m]

              Almost there

   We opened github.com/login/device in your
   browser. Paste this code and approve:

         ┌────────────────────────┐
         │       ABCD-EFGH        │   ✓ copied
         └────────────────────────┘

   We'll pick it up the moment you approve.

   ────────────────────────────────────
   Code expires in 9:42                ← live mm:ss

   [ Open browser again ]              ← fallback only;
                                         secondary style
```

Notes:
- **Code is the focal point.** Display size, monospace
  (`--font-mono`), high-contrast text — readable across the room
  in case the user moved their browser to a second monitor.
- **"✓ copied"** confirmation appears immediately, fades after 4s.
  No toast. No modal. The page is the affordance.
- **Live `mm:ss` countdown** of `expires_in` — concrete, not "a few
  minutes." On <60s remaining, the countdown switches to red and a
  subtle "Code expires soon" inline appears (no modal).
- **"Open browser again"** is the recovery affordance for the user
  who dismissed the browser tab. Secondary style; not a primary
  CTA. Does NOT request a new code — same code, same expiry.
- **No "Cancel" button.** Closing the window via the OS chrome
  cancels. Tray icon retains the badge so they can return.

#### State 3 — Connected (success bridge)

Triggered by `/auth/poll` returning `{ status: "ready" }`. Brief
moment (~600ms) for the user to see the success before the bridge.

```
                  [brand m]

             You're connected

      Signed in as @stuffbucket.
      Maximal is serving on localhost:4142.


      Next: point a client at it.


   ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
   │   Show me how              →     │   ← bridges to Dashboard
   └──────────────────────────────────┘
```

Click "Show me how":
- Setup window closes.
- Dashboard opens with the **Connect section scrolled into view**
  (deep-link via `#connect` anchor).
- The Activity section below is empty, but its empty state teaches
  the next action (see "Activity empty state" below).

If the user closes State 3 without clicking the bridge, no harm:
the tray's "Open Maximal" now opens the Dashboard directly.

### Activity empty state — the actual aha moment

Lives in the Dashboard PRD's Recent Activity section. Specified
here because it's the second beat of the onboarding arc, and the
Setup → Dashboard bridge depends on it being right.

```
   Recent activity
   ────────────────────────────────

         No requests yet.

         Try this from a terminal:

   ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
   │  curl http://localhost:4142/v1/  │
   │       chat/completions \         │
   │    -H "x-api-key: maximal_…"  \  │   ← real key, masked
   │    -H "content-type: application │
   │            /json" \              │
   │    -d '{"model":"gpt-5",         │
   │         "messages":[{"role":     │
   │         "user","content":"hi"}]}'│
   └──────────────────────────────────┘
              [ Copy ]

   Your first request will appear here
   when it arrives.
```

Notes:
- **Real working command** — pre-populated with the user's actual
  port, model, and either their first generated API key (if one
  exists) or a single-line note "Generate a key in Settings →
  API clients" with a deep-link.
- **Show, don't tell.** No tutorial popup. No "Click here to
  continue." The instruction IS the action.
- **The feed will SSE-update** the moment that curl completes; the
  user sees their request transcribed in real time in the same
  window. That's the peak moment.

### Tray menu while not ready

The earlier PRD spec'd a "Sign in with GitHub" tray-menu item as a
bypass. Re-evaluating: this duplicates the Setup window's CTA and
adds a menu item that disappears on first success. Drop it. The
Setup window is one click away from "Open Maximal" and shows the
same affordance.

Tray menu while unauthed:

```
[badge] maximal
   Open Maximal       (subtitled: "Set up first")
   Settings
   ──────────
   Quit Maximal
```

The "Set up first" subtitle is the breadcrumb. Clicking the
greyed item still opens the Setup window — the greying is signal,
not a block.

## Failure Modes

- **Sidecar doesn't bind to 4142 within 5s.** Shell shows a "Maximal failed to start" tray subtitle + Settings → Reveal logs. Same path users have today, just made explicit.
- **`/setup-status` returns 500.** Treat as `ready: false` with reason "internal error"; surface in setup window with a "Reveal logs" affordance.
- **Device-code polling slow / token never arrives.** Setup page surfaces the remaining `expires_in` countdown; on expiry, offers "Try again" which re-invokes `/auth/start`.
- **User closes setup window mid-flow.** Tray persists; the auth state is whatever the proxy has so far. Reopening the setup window resumes polling against the still-live device code if not expired.

## Telemetry / Observability

- `/_debug/state` gains a `setup` block mirroring `/setup-status` (same shape, served behind the verbose flag).
- Each `/setup-status` call logs at debug-level only — not info — to avoid noise during shell polling.
- Boot path logs `evaluateSetup()` result once at info-level.

## Migration

The Tauri shell already exists. The proxy side is additive (one new route, one new module). No on-disk format changes. Users upgrading from a working CLI install will have `ready: true` immediately; the setup window never appears.

## Open Questions

1. Should `/setup-status` include a check for *available* provider keys (Anthropic etc.) as an advisory? Lean **no** for v1 — out-of-scope per Non-Goals — but the shape is forward-compatible.
2. Should the setup window survive a sidecar crash? Lean **yes** — display "Sidecar offline, retrying…" rather than going blank.
3. Should the tray badge persist on subsequent launches once setup completes, or only show during the unsetup phase? Lean **only unsetup**; ready = no badge.
4. CLI `maximal setup-status` command (machine-readable mirror of the HTTP route) — useful for shell scripts and `claude-code` plugins. Cheap; include in v1 unless it complicates the citty CLI surface.

## Acceptance

A fresh `.dmg` install on a Mac with no `~/.local/share/maximal/` directory:

1. User double-clicks Maximal.app.
2. Tray icon appears within ~2s; carries a "needs setup" badge.
3. Clicking the tray icon shows: "Open Maximal" subtitled "Set up first," "Settings," "Quit Maximal." No separate "Sign in with GitHub" item.
4. Clicking "Open Maximal" opens the Setup window in State 1 (Welcome).
5. The user clicks "Sign in with GitHub." Window transitions to State 2 (Waiting); their browser opens to `github.com/login/device` with the code already pasted in their clipboard.
6. The user pastes the code, approves. Within ~5s of approval, the window transitions to State 3 (Connected), then auto-bridges to the Dashboard with the Connect section scrolled into view.
7. The user copies the sample `curl` from the Connect section, runs it in a terminal. Within ~1s, the request appears in the Dashboard's Activity feed via SSE — the aha moment.
8. Subsequent launches go straight to the Dashboard with no badge, no Setup window.

No terminal touched. No env vars set. The CLI install path remains unchanged.
