# maximal — positioning

Internal messaging reference. Grounded in the *AI in Design* survey (Q1 2026,
~900 practising designers). Keeps our copy honest and consistent across the
site, the guide, the README, and any pitch.

## What maximal is (canonical)

> maximal is a desktop app that lets the AI coding tools you already use —
> Claude Code, Codex, opencode, Claude Desktop, and any Anthropic or OpenAI SDK
> client — run on the models in your GitHub Copilot plan. No extra API keys, no
> second bill: the Copilot plan you already pay for becomes the fuel for the
> tools you actually reach for. Switch a tool on and it just works.

Use this (or a trimmed version of it) wherever we define the product. Do not
drift into "reverse proxy", "gateway", or infrastructure language — the reader
is a designer-to-developer spectrum, not a platform engineer.

## The market reality (why now)

The survey is the strongest external evidence we have that maximal is aimed at a
real, growing problem:

- **The toolstack is exploding.** Designers now run an average of **7** off-the-shelf
  AI tools, up from **3** a year ago — plus a rise in bespoke and company-internal
  tools not even counted. Every one of those wants its own access, keys, or bill.
- **AI moved into the coding/production layer — where maximal operates.** The
  biggest year-over-year jumps are code generation & front-end (**50%, +31**),
  wireframing (**43%, +27**), design systems & components (**33%, +24**), and
  developer handoff (**23%, +12**). The front of the process (ideation, hi-fi
  visual) is flat; stakeholder decks actually declined. In the survey's words,
  "AI has moved out of the front of the process and into the production and
  systematisation layer."
- **Coding agents are the most-adopted tools, period.** Among *designers*,
  **Claude Code leads everything at 65%** (Cursor 39%, Codex 15%, Replit 8%).
  maximal's headline supported tool is the one the market already reached for.
- **The reality is multi-provider.** Claude **78%** (now #1, up from 52%), ChatGPT
  **65%** (down from 88%), Gemini **48%** (up from 21%). People run several at
  once — which is exactly why maximal is "any tool, any model in your plan," not
  one blessed model.
- **Usage is constant.** Weekly AI use for design tasks went **54% → 91%** in a
  year; **75%** use it daily. A second per-tool subscription is a real, felt cost.

## The wedge

**People love the tools; they pay for the plan.** GitHub Copilot's *own* direct
use is only **9%** — yet it is the plan many people (and their employers) already
pay for. maximal turns that underused spend into the fuel for the tools people
actually reach for (Claude Code, Codex, and the rest). That gap — 65% Claude Code
vs 9% Copilot-the-app — is the sharpest single fact in the dataset.

**The bill is a counterfactual — frame it that way.** With maximal, nobody sees a
second bill; the value is the bill you *avoid*. Without maximal, each tool needs
its own paid API subscription. Say "one plan, not one per tool," not just "no
second bill" — the point is the per-tool cost you'd otherwise rack up, not the
absence of cost.

**It lands hardest on design teams.** Designers now lean on coding agents (Claude
Code 65%) but rarely hold dev-side API budgets or keys, so the per-tool
subscription barrier falls on them disproportionately. Two implications: keep the
copy legible to the non-technical end of the spectrum, and treat "design teams
priced out of the tools they already use" as a strong candidate angle if we ever
segment the messaging.

## Messaging pillars

1. **Your ecosystem, unified.** One connection behind a toolstack that keeps
   multiplying (3 → 7). ("maximalize your AI ecosystem.")
2. **The tools you love, the plan you have.** Keep Claude Code / Codex / opencode;
   fund them with the Copilot plan you already pay for.
3. **Any tool, any model in your plan.** Multi-provider by default — set a tool,
   pick a model from your plan.
4. **Nothing new to set up.** No extra API keys, no second bill, no change to how
   your tool works.

## Guardrails (over-claims to avoid)

- **Don't imply maximal replaces the tools.** It runs the tools people already
  love; it's the connection underneath them, never a competitor to Claude Code /
  Codex.
- **Don't sell Copilot's UX.** Its direct use is only 9%; the value is the *plan
  and the models it grants*, not the Copilot interface. Never "Copilot is great,
  use it."
- **"Any model" means any model in your Copilot plan** — never arbitrary models
  outside it. Keep "in your Copilot plan" attached wherever models are mentioned.
- **"No second bill" ≠ free.** The point is no *new* per-tool subscription, not
  zero cost.
- **Economics is the hook, capability is the lead.** A cheapness-only frame
  undersells the "tools you love, models you have" unlock and cheapens the brand.
- **Keep the hero billing-free.** The economic angle lives in the explainer's
  "No second bill" note, not the top tagline (a deliberate call — the hero stays
  human and universal for the non-technical end of the audience).
- **Never** "proxy". Format-neutral desktop wording only (no "menu bar" / "tray").

## Where each fact earns its place

| Surface | Lead with |
|---|---|
| Hero | The human promise — the tools you love, the models you have (billing-free). |
| Explainer ("maximalize your AI ecosystem") | The coding-layer sharpening + the tools→models rail; "No second bill" note carries the economics. |
| Guide overview / README | The canonical definition above. |
| Pitch / launch | The wedge: 65% Claude Code vs 9% Copilot; 3 → 7 toolstack. |
