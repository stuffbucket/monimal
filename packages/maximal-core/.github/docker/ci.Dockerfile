# The pinned toolchain image. Built and run by `scripts/dev/container.ts`;
# see docs/dev/container-toolchain.md for why this exists.
#
# Nothing from the repo is COPYed in. The source tree is bind-mounted at run
# time, so this image is a pure function of the toolchain and only has to be
# rebuilt when the toolchain moves — not when the code does.
#
# Build context is this directory, not the repo root: a repo-root context would
# upload node_modules and dist on every build for a Dockerfile that reads
# neither.

# Node 24 for unflagged `node:sqlite` — ci.yml's `test` job verifies that import
# explicitly before anything else runs, and src/lib/platform/sqlite.ts depends
# on it. Bun is NOT the base image: it is installed below by the same
# `bun.sh/install` line the composite action runs, so the container and every CI
# job get Bun by an identical path (see docs/dev/container-toolchain.md).
#
# Pinned by DIGEST, not just by tag. `node:24-bookworm-slim` is a floating tag —
# it moves on every upstream rebuild — so a tag-only base makes this image a
# function of the day it was built as well as of `.bun-version`, and the
# `bun-<pin>` tag stops being the whole story. The digest is the multi-arch
# index digest, so it resolves on arm64 and amd64 alike. Refresh it with:
#
#     docker buildx imagetools inspect node:24-bookworm-slim   # take `Digest:`
