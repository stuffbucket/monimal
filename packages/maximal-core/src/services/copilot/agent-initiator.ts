/**
 * Single source of truth for agent-vs-user initiator detection.
 *
 * The `x-initiator` header this drives feeds Copilot's credit accounting
 * (an "agent" turn is billed differently from a "user" turn), so this is a
 * billing-correctness surface, not cosmetics. Historically each of the three
 * upstream builders re-derived it a subtly different way; they now all route
 * through this module.
 *
 * The three request shapes genuinely differ (Anthropic content blocks vs
 * OpenAI chat roles vs Responses input items), so the rules are kept as three
 * explicit, per-shape functions rather than being forced through one leaky
 * predicate. What is shared is the *intent* — "does the last turn originate
 * from the agent rather than the user?" — and its home.
