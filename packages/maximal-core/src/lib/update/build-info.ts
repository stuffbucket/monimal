/**
 * Compile-time build metadata.
 *
 * Values are injected by `bun build --compile --define ...` for release
 * binaries. **Core no longer compiles one** — delivery is the GitHub Package
 * Registry — but the compile did not stop happening, so these are NOT dead:
 *
 *   - `scripts/build-sidecar.ts` in `stuffbucket/maximal` compiles **this
 *     repo's `src/main.ts`**, reached through the git dependency at
 *     `shell/node_modules/@stuffbucket/maximal-core/src/main.ts`, and injects
 *     all four defines itself.
 *
 * That is now the only producer, it is the one that ships to users, and nothing
 * in this repo references it — which is exactly why this paragraph is here. Do
 * not treat these globals as dead because core's own binary pipeline is gone:
 * the downstream compile still sets them, so `BUILD_CHANNEL` still decides
 * which channel a shipped build polls (`src/lib/update/update-check.ts`) and
 * `BUILD_GIT_SHA` still lands in `x-maximal-version`.
 *
 * All four are injected together: `__MAXIMAL_VERSION__` (from package.json),
 * `__MAXIMAL_GIT_SHA__` (short SHA), `__MAXIMAL_GIT_BRANCH__`, and
 * `__MAXIMAL_CHANNEL__` (derived from the version's prerelease tag). When unset
 * — running source via `bun src/main.ts`, or after a stock `bun build` without
 * the defines — we fall back to package.json's version and leave the git SHA
 * undefined (the live `.git` walk in `src/lib/update/version.ts` picks it up in
 * dev).
 *
 * Why globals + --define instead of build-time codegen: identical
 * effect, no .gen.ts file to gitignore, no extra prebuild script
 * to keep wired into every place that runs the code (CI, IDE,
 * postinstall, dev). Bun's --define honors literal substitution
 * at bundle time IFF the bare identifier appears in source — it
 * does NOT walk through `globalThis[name]` lookups. So we read
 * the bare identifier directly here, with declarations below to
 * keep TypeScript happy and a `typeof` guard so the dev path
 * (where the substitution didn't happen) doesn't ReferenceError.
