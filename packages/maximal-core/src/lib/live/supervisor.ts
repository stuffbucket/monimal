 * SILENTLY: the splash simply stops updating and shows a blank "Starting…"
 * again — the exact failure the marker exists to prevent, with no error
 * anywhere (maximal-core#110).
 *
 * - `BOOT_STATUS_MARKER` — prefixes a boot-phase line; use `parseBootStatus`
 *   rather than matching it by hand.
 * - `QUIT_REQUEST_MARKER` / `UPDATE_REQUEST_MARKER` — whole lines with no

 * supervise an older or newer engine than themselves:

 * - **v1** — `{v:1, controlPort, proxyPort, pid}`, two listeners. Any higher `v`
 *   carrying those fields parses too: a newer engine must not hang an older host.
 * - **v0** (no `v`) — the original `{port, pid}`, normalised by pointing both
 *   ports at it, which is what that engine actually did.
 *
 * Returns `ParsedReadyLine`, **not** `ReadyLine`: the v0 branch reports `v: 0`,
 * which the emitter's `v >= 1` does not admit. Annotating this `ReadyLine` type-
 * checks (`0` is a `number`) and is exactly the lie this signature avoids.
 * Nothing else changes for a caller — normalisation is total, so the ports and
 * pid are usable without narrowing on `v`.
 *
 * Returns null rather than throwing on a malformed marker line: a supervisor
 * should keep reading (the real line may follow) instead of aborting a healthy
 * boot over one garbled write.

 * (maximal-core#10), and the pid because it is the invalidation key for a cached

 *
 * Resolves with a `ParsedReadyLine`, so an engine older than this host resolves

 * because exiting a `for await` calls `iterator.return()`, which destroys a Node
 * Readable — closing the read end of the pipe so the sidecar dies with `EPIPE`
 * on its very next log line. The host keeps ownership and must continue draining
