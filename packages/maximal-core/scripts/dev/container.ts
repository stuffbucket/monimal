/**
 * Run this repo's checks inside the pinned toolchain image.
 *
 *   bun run container:build              # build the image for the current pin
 *   bun run container:run -- <command>   # run <command> in it, on this tree
 *   bun run container:shell              # interactive bash in it
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `dist/main.js` is committed and is a function of the Bun version
 * (docs/bun-version-policy.md), so `bindings:check` is only meaningful on the
 * pin — and `bun run build` re-resolves a bare `bun` from PATH, so putting the
 * pinned Bun somewhere is not enough, it has to be *first*. Getting that wrong
 * does not fail loudly: it reports the committed bundle as stale, which sends
 * you to regenerate it on the wrong toolchain. The container removes the
 * question by removing the choice.
 *
 * CI never had this problem — every workflow `cat .bun-version` into
 * `.github/actions/setup-bun`. The failure is local, which is why this ships
 * before any change to ci.yml.
 *
 * ## The tag IS the pin
 *
 * `maximal-core-ci:bun-<version>`, read from `.bun-version`. A stale image is
 * therefore not addressable: bump the pin and the tag you ask for does not
 * exist yet, so it gets built. There is no floating name for the toolchain to
 * drift behind, and so no parity gate to keep honest.
 *
 * See docs/dev/container-toolchain.md for the whole picture, including the two
 * decisions below that are load-bearing and easy to "simplify" away.
 *
 * Exit code: the container's, so this is transparent in a `&&` chain.

 * resolves upward past an empty directory, and `bun build` writes its module
 * banner comments relative to the root it actually resolved. Byte-different
 * output for byte-identical sources (measured: 21 banner lines).
 *
 * REMOVING IT WAS TRIED, AND IT BREAKS THE NEXT RUN. `rmdir`ing the directory
 * docker created as the volume's mount target leaves the shared filesystem in a
 * state where the following `docker run` mounts nothing useful there. Measured,
 * from a fresh clone with no `node_modules`, three container runs in sequence:
 *
 *     with the removal      bindings:check ok · bun test 0 pass / 144 errors
 *                           ("Cannot find package 'consola'") · build "Could

 *                           build ok
 *
 * The packages were in the volume the whole time — a later `ls` from inside the
 * container listed both. So the cleanup did not merely fail to help, it took
 * the toolchain out from under the very next command, which is a far worse
 * failure than the residue it was removing. It is not done.
 *
 * WHAT IS DONE INSTEAD IS TO SAY SO. The residue's remaining harm is confined
 * to HOST-side builds, and #125 already closed the dangerous half of that: the
 * `node_modules/.bin` probe makes `bindings:check` and `bun run build` report
 * "could not verify" with `bun install` as the named fix, rather than rebuilding
 * and calling the result stale. So what is left is a developer meeting that
 * message later with no idea where the empty directory came from. One line at
