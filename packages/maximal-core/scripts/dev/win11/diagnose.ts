/**
 * Post-mortem for a guest that misbehaved, from its files alone.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every failure this tool has ever had looked the same from
 * outside: a QEMU process that is running, a pidfile that is valid, and a
 * monitor that answers "VM status: running". The difference between "installing
 * normally", "wedged in firmware", "provisioning never started" and "the answer
 * file silently skipped a pass" is only ever visible in the artifacts each one
 * leaves behind — and knowing which artifact to read took a long time to learn.
 *
 * So each check below encodes ONE incident that actually happened here, with the
 * evidence that identified it and the way out. Reading files only, never the
 * guest: this has to work on an instance that is dead, wedged, or long stopped.
