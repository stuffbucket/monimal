# Provisioning for the winvm Windows 11 ARM64 guest.
#
# Runs once, at the END OF SETUP, via C:\Windows\Setup\Scripts\SetupComplete.cmd
# -- which Windows executes as SYSTEM before any user logs on. The answer file's
# specialize pass copies this script and that wrapper into place.
#
# NOT FirstLogonCommands: that needs a user session, runs unelevated (so the
# guest-tools installer raises a UAC dialog nobody can answer), and on 25H2 is
# silently suppressed by the deprecated Skip*OOBE settings. All three failures
# look identical from outside -- the desktop appears and nothing has run.
#
# THIS SCRIPT KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ANY PARTICULAR PROJECT. It installs the guest
# tools, then stages whatever the caller put in the seed's `payload\` directory:
# every .zip is expanded into C:\payload\<name>, and if a `setup.ps1` is present
# it is run afterwards. That is the whole contract. A consumer that wants Bun
# passes a Bun zip; one that wants something else passes something else.
#
# WHY IT SEARCHES FOR VOLUMES INSTEAD OF USING DRIVE LETTERS.
#
# The VM attaches several removable volumes plus an NVMe disk, and Windows
# assigns letters by enumeration order — a property of the QEMU command line,
# not a contract. UTM's own answer file hard-codes
# `E:\utm-guest-tools-0.1.271.exe` and so breaks both when device order shifts
# AND when the tools version bumps. Searching by a file that identifies the
# volume costs three lines and removes both failure modes.

    # staging nothing. The payload directory only ever exists on the seed.
    #
    # Payloads are shipped on the seed rather than downloaded, so what runs is
    # exactly what the caller pinned rather than whatever an installer resolves
    # on the day. It also does not depend on the NIC, whose driver has only just
