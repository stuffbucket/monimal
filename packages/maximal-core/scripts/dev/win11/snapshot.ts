/**
 * Snapshots: capture a running guest, and put it back.
 *
 * A snapshot here is QEMU's `savevm` — the whole machine, RAM included, stored
 * inside the instance's own qcow2 files. Restoring one is not a reboot: the
 * guest resumes mid-instruction from the moment it was taken, which is why a
 * rewind costs under a second instead of the half-minute a boot costs.
 *
 * THREE THINGS HAD TO CHANGE BEFORE THIS WORKED AT ALL, and each announced
 * itself as a flat refusal from `savevm` naming a device:
 *
 *   - the NVMe boot disk        -> "non-migratable"; the disk moved to virtio-blk
 *   - the raw pflash vars       -> "does not support snapshots"; now qcow2
 *   - the writable result image -> same; now read-only once installed
 *
 * All three are enforced in qemu.ts. If one regresses, every command here fails
 * with QEMU's own words rather than silently taking nothing.
