/**
 * Harness: sidecar process lifecycle, against a real spawned sidecar.
 *
 * **A harness, not a test head and not a product surface.** Run it with
 * `bun run e2e:lifecycle`.
 *
 * Why this exists: a supervised engine must not outlive its supervisor. If the
 * parent-death watchdog does not fire, every host crash leaks an engine that
 * still holds a port and still refreshes tokens — the failure a user only
 * notices as "why is my machine warm", and one no unit test can observe because
 * the whole mechanism is a real process watching another real process die.
 *
 * The watched parent is a **decoy**: the sidecar is spawned as a child of this
 * harness (so its pipes stay readable and cleanup is guaranteed) but told to
 * watch a throwaway process instead. The watchdog only ever probes with
 * `kill(pid, 0)`, so it cannot tell the difference — and this way the harness
 * can kill the watched parent without killing itself.
 *
 * ## Portability
 *
 * This harness used to be the one POSIX-only piece of the suite, because the
 * decoy was `sleep 120`. That single word is why the Windows leg of the
 * since-removed binary pipeline shipped v0.3.2 with an artifact check and
 * nothing else. The decoy is now Bun itself (see `startDecoyParent`), so the
 * whole suite runs on both platforms — which is what lets `ci.yml`'s `windows`
 * job run it.
 *
 * One thing still does not port, and is not pretended away below: **Windows has
 * no SIGTERM.** `child.kill("SIGTERM")` there is `TerminateProcess`, so the
 * first block proves the binary is *terminable*, not that it drained. The
 * watchdog block is unaffected — it exits through userspace `process.exit(0)`
 * — and it is the block this harness exists for.
 *
 * Not part of `bun test`: the watchdog polls on a multi-second interval.

 * A throwaway process for the sidecar's watchdog to watch and this harness to

 *
 * It has to satisfy three things at once: exist on every runner, stay alive and
 * idle for the length of the run, and be killable. `sleep 120` satisfies all
 * three on POSIX and none on Windows — `sleep` is not a Windows command, and
 * the near-equivalents are worse: `timeout /t` refuses to run when stdin is not
 * a console (`ERROR: Input redirection is not supported`), which is exactly how
 * a harness spawns things, and `ping -n` is a busy-wait dressed as a sleep.
 *
 * So use the runtime instead of the shell. `process.execPath` is the Bun
 * already interpreting this file, which makes it present by construction on any
 * machine that can run the harness at all — no PATH lookup, no `.exe`
 * extension, no shell, and one process rather than a wrapper around one.
 *
 * It announces itself on stdout before going idle, and we wait for that line.
 * A decoy that failed to start would otherwise hand back a pid that is already
 * dead, and the watchdog check below would go green for the wrong reason.
