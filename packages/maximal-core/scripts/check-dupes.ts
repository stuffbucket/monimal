/**
 * check-dupes.ts — what `bun run dupes:check` runs. jscpd, plus a down-only
 * ratchet on the pairs of files that share copy-pasted code.
 *
 *   bun run dupes                 # inventory: every clone, grouped, with numbers
 *   bun run dupes:check           # the gate (check:deep runs this)
 *   bun run dupes:check --update  # re-record after removing a duplication
 *
 * ─── What was measured before any of this was designed ───────────────────────
 * jscpd over `src`, `tests` and `scripts`, TypeScript only, at three settings:
 *
 *   min-tokens   clones   duplicated lines
 *   30            457     6.15%
 *   50            119     2.48%
 *   100            13     0.55%
 *
 * and at min-tokens 50, split by tree:
 *
 *   src        167 files   0.33%    10 clones    9 of them inside one file
 *   scripts     28 files   0.95%    11 clones
 *   tests      138 files   5.16%    96 clones
 *
 * Three things follow, and between them they picked every number in this file.
 *
 * **50 is the floor.** At 30 the cross-file matches in `src` go from 1 to 17,
 * and the new 16 are import blocks (`create-chat-completions.ts` ↔
 * `create-responses.ts`, lines 1–8) and the parallel route-handler idiom
 * (`chat-completions/handler.ts` ↔ `responses/handler.ts`, three times). Those
 * are the shape of the codebase, not a defect in it. `scripts/dev/e2e-feed.ts`
 * ↔ `e2e-seam.ts` starts matching there too — the check/reporter idiom every
 * e2e script shares. A detector that reports those gets turned off, and then
 * detects nothing.
 *
 * **`tests/**` is not gated.** 96 of the 119 clones are there, and reading them
 * they are near-identical *test bodies* — `messages-preprocess-pdf-attachments`
 * against itself 13 times, `auth-controller-lifecycle` against
 * `auth-controller` 6 times. A test that repeats its neighbour's structure with
 * one field changed is usually correct, and deduplicating it into a table costs
 * the thing tests are for: reading the failure and knowing what broke. They are
 * in `--list` so they can be looked at, and out of the gate so nobody is forced
 * to.
 *
 * **`scripts/**` is not gated either**, for a smaller reason: it is tooling,
 * not the product, and its one real pair (`release-gates.ts` ↔
 * `release-notes.ts`) is release plumbing that another workstream is actively
 * moving. Gating it would fail PRs on churn in a tree the gate has no opinion
 * about.
 *
 * ─── Why a pair of files, and not a percentage ───────────────────────────────
 * The obvious gate is jscpd's own `--threshold`: fail over N% duplication. It
 * cannot work here, and the arithmetic says so. `src` is 31,363 lines at 0.33%.
 * A 40-line function copy-pasted into a second file moves that to 0.46%. Fifty
 * of them would still sit under 1%. So any threshold loose enough to be green
 * today is loose enough to swallow every copy-paste anyone will actually
 * commit, and the gate would report success for the entire class of event it
 * exists to catch. This is the same argument `check-deps.ts` makes against
 * counting cycles, and it lands harder here because the denominator is bigger.
 *
 * So the ratchet holds a SET, as `check-deps.ts` does. The identity has to be
 * something an unrelated edit cannot perturb, which rules out the obvious
 * candidate: a clone is reported as two line ranges, and inserting a line
 * anywhere above one of them rewrites the entry. A baseline that churns on
 * every edit gets `--update`d reflexively, which is the same as not having one.
 *
 * The **unordered pair of files** is invariant under that. It also matches what
 * a reviewer wants to know — "these two files share copy-pasted code" — and it
 * is what changes when someone actually copies code: a new pair appears.
 *
 * ─── Cross-file only ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 92 of the 119 clones are a file against itself, and in `src` it is 9 of 10:
 * two nearly-identical SSE event branches in
 * `responses-stream-translation.ts`, two arms of a settings endpoint. Those are
 * a local factoring question, visible in the diff that creates them, and the
 * reviewer is already looking at the file. Cross-file duplication is the case
 * where nobody sees both halves — which is exactly the case worth mechanizing.
 * Intra-file clones stay in `--list`.
 *
 * ─── What this does NOT catch, stated plainly ────────────────────────────────
 * This tool finds copy-paste. It does not find *reimplementation*. The question
 * that prompted building it — "was this port fix implemented twice, two
 * different ways?" — is one jscpd cannot answer, because two different
 * implementations of the same idea share no tokens. Nothing here should be read
 * as covering that. It covers the other half of the class, the literal half.
 *
 * It is also pair-granular by construction: a *second* copy-paste between two
 * files that already share one does not add a pair, so it passes. That is the
 * same limitation `check-deps.ts` accepts for its edges, for the same reason —
 * the alternative identity is not stable enough to be worth the precision.
 *
 * When the list reaches zero, delete it and this ratchet with it.
