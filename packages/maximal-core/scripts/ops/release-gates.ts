/**
 * Release gates — the three conventions in `docs/release-runbook.md`, checked
 * by a machine instead of by memory.
 *
 * The runbook's release model is "a release is a GitHub milestone whose title
 * IS the tag" (see `release-notes.ts`). Three rules hold that model together,
 * and until this file every one of them was upheld by human discipline alone:
 *
 *   1. **A PR carries a release milestone.** Without one it silently ships in
 *      whatever release is cut next and never appears in generated notes,
 *      because `release:notes` only ever sees the PRs in the milestone.
 *   2. **A breaking change is bumped to a MINOR, not a patch.** Pre-1.0 this
 *      repo's rule is feat/fix → patch, `feat!:`/`fix!:` → minor. That is not
 *      cosmetic: a consumer's `^0.2.0` resolves to `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0`, so a
 *      breaking change released as a patch is AUTO-INSTALLED on a routine
 *      update. This repo publishes `./supervisor` and `./control-contract`,
 *      consumed outside the repo — PR #14 removed `port` from the published
 *      `ReadyLine` type and was initially bucketed as a patch. Caught by hand;
 *      this gate is what catches it next time.
 *   3. **A tag matches `package.json`'s version.** Already gone wrong:
 *      `git show v0.1.1:package.json` reads `0.1.0`.
 *   4. **A tag is greater than every tag that already exists.** Nothing asserted
 *      this at all: gate 2 compares a milestone against the released version at
 *      the moment the CHECK runs, which is not the moment the TAG is pushed. Two
 *      releases prepared concurrently can therefore land in either order, and a
 *      lower tag carrying more content cannot be repaired afterwards — see
 *      `evaluateTagOrder`.
 *   5. **Nothing that claims to ship in this release is still open.** Held up
 *      only as a side effect of `release:notes` refusing to emit, which
 *      `release.ts` skips entirely when the changelog entry already exists —
 *      see `evaluateOpenPrs`.
 *
 * Five subcommands, one per convention plus the release-time aggregate:
 *
 *   pr <number>        gates 1 + 2 for one PR (the PR-time workflow)
 *   milestone <vX.Y.Z> gates 2 + 5 across a milestone (release preflight)
 *   order <vX.Y.Z>     gate 4 (local + remote tags; `--pushed` for a tripwire)
 *   version <vX.Y.Z>   gate 3 (tag vs package.json — preflight + tag tripwire)
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run release:check pr 42
 *   bun run release:check milestone v0.3.0
 *   bun run release:check order v0.3.0
 *   bun run release:check version v0.3.0
 *   bun run release:check pr 42 --repo stuffbucket/maximal-core --mode warn
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 clean (or `--mode warn`) · 1 a blocking finding · 2 the gate
 * could not run (bad usage, `gh` failure, unreadable package.json). Callers
 * MUST treat 2 as "not blocking" — a gate that fails closed on its own bugs
 * takes the repo down with it. `release-gates.yml` does exactly that.
 *
 * `release.ts` is the exception, and deliberately so: it runs gates 4 and 5
 * itself before `bumpp`, where a 2 means "refused, nothing happened" rather than
 * "the repo is wedged". Nothing downstream of that point is reversible.
 *
 * Escape hatches, in increasing blast radius:
 *   - `release-gate-override` label on one PR → every finding downgraded to a
 *     warning, with the reason printed.
 *   - `--mode warn` → nothing blocks (the workflow reads this from the
 *     `RELEASE_GATES_MODE` repo variable, so a misfiring gate is defused in
 *     seconds without a PR).
 *
 * All GitHub access goes through `release-notes.ts`'s single injectable
 * `GhRunner` and all repository access through `check-bindings.ts`'s `GitRunner`,
 * so every test here runs offline with no network, no repository and no
 * `mock.module`.

 *
 * A published tag is immutable in practice — `docs/release-runbook.md` forbids
 * moving one, because a consumer's `bun.lock` pins the resolved SHA and only
 * `bun update` re-resolves, so a moved tag means two machines hold different
 * code under one version. The damage is therefore done the instant the tag is
 * pushed. That rules out tag-push as the PRIMARY placement: it can only ever
 * alarm after the fact.
 *
 * So the preventive placement is a PREFLIGHT the human runs before pushing
 * (`bun run release:check version vX.Y.Z`, wired into runbook §4). But
 * "a human runs it" is precisely the discipline this file exists to replace,
 * so a preflight alone is not enough either.
 *
 * Hence both, with different jobs: the preflight PREVENTS, and a tag-push
 * workflow (`release-tag-check.yml`) DETECTS — it is the only placement that
 * can see the tag that was actually pushed, and it fires within seconds, while
 * the tag is still almost certainly unconsumed and can be deleted rather than
 * moved. It is deliberately NOT wired onto the release commit as a third
 * placement: `release:tag` re-reads the MERGED `package.json` and refuses unless
 * it is exactly the version about to be tagged — the same assertion, one step
 * earlier, against the only tree the tag can point at.

 * already exists, and does not exist itself.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING. Gate 3 asserts tag == `package.json`. Gate 2 asserts the
 * milestone is ahead of the current release *at the moment the check runs*.
 * Neither is an assertion about the moment the tag is PUSHED, and nothing
 * anywhere compared the tag being cut against the tags that already exist. With
 * two releases in flight at once — which is the normal state of this repo, four
 * agents deep — `v0.5.0` and `v0.4.4` can be prepared concurrently and land in
 * either order. If `v0.5.0` lands first, `v0.4.4` is a LOWER-semver tag carrying
 * strictly more content, and it cannot be repaired: `docs/release-runbook.md`
 * forbids moving a published tag, because a consumer's `bun.lock` pins the
 * resolved SHA and only `bun update` re-resolves.
 *
 * WHERE IT RUNS, AND WHY THERE — TWICE, ONCE PER RELEASE PHASE.
 * `release:prepare` runs it ahead of `bumpp`, the same placement argument the
 * clean-tree guard makes: a refusal there costs a re-run rather than a version
 * spent. `release:tag` runs it AGAIN, immediately before the tag is created,
 * because that is now the last line before the tag exists and the release PR may
 * have sat open for hours — long enough for another agent to push the very tag
 * this gate is about. Neither placement is a preflight a human runs, because "a
 * human runs it" is the discipline these gates replace, and neither is only a
 * tag-push workflow, because by then the tag is immutable. The `order`
 * subcommand exists for the by-hand path in runbook §4 and for a tag-push
 * tripwire (`--pushed`), both of which are secondary.
 *
 * WHICH TAGS IT COMPARES AGAINST — LOCAL **AND** REMOTE. A local checkout is
 * stale by default: nothing fetches tags on its own, so a tag another agent (or
 * another machine) pushed five minutes ago is invisible to `git tag --list`.
 * That is exactly the race this gate exists for, so the remote is authoritative
 * and is read every time. The local list is unioned in rather than replaced,
 * because a tag that exists only locally is still one this release would collide
 * with on push.
 *
 * The remote is read with `git ls-remote --tags`, not `git fetch --tags`, on
 * purpose: `ls-remote` writes nothing. A guard that mutates the ref store of the
 * repository it is about to refuse from would leave the tree different from how
 * it found it — the one property the whole refusal path is built on. An
 * unreachable remote is a THROW (exit 2, "the gate could not run"), never a
 * pass: the flow ends in `git push` anyway, so a release that cannot see the
 * remote was never going to complete.
 *
 * PRERELEASES DO NOT BLOCK. `vX.Y.Z-rc.1` is not a release tag to any of this
 * tooling (`RELEASE_TAG_RE` is exact), and by semver a prerelease sorts BELOW
 * the release it precedes — `v0.5.0-rc.1` is not evidence that `0.5.0` shipped.
 * So prereleases are excluded from the comparison and reported as a WARNING when
 * their base version sorts at or above the tag being cut, which is the case
 * where one plausibly means "someone else is already cutting 0.5.0".
 *
 * No third comparator is written here. Exact release tags go through this file's
 * `compareVersions`; the prerelease advisory goes through `semverGt` from
 * `watch-external-drift.ts` (which `release-notes.ts` already reuses), whose
 * `parseSemver` truncates at the suffix and therefore compares base versions.

// --- gate 5 (pure) ---

/**
 * Gate 5: what is still OPEN when the tag is cut.
 *
 * WHAT WAS ALREADY COVERED, AND WHY THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH. `release:notes`
 * refuses to emit when a milestone contains an open PR, and `release.ts` calls
 * it before `bumpp`, so an open PR in the milestone blocks a release today. But
 * it blocks as a SIDE EFFECT of notes generation, and that side effect has a
 * hole: `release.ts` skips the whole changelog step — `gh` reads included — when
 * `CHANGELOG.md` already documents the version. A re-run after a failed `bumpp`,
 * or a hand-pasted entry, therefore cuts the tag with the open PR unnoticed.
 * This gate states the rule directly instead, and `release.ts` runs it
 * unconditionally.
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT CHECKABLE. The milestone model is what makes any of this
 * decidable: a PR pre-selects its release. So each open PR is classified by
 * where it points, and only one of the four cases is a violation:
 *
 *   - **In the milestone being cut** → BLOCKING. It said it ships here; it will
 *     not be in the tag and will not be in the notes. Not a judgement call.
 *   - **In a LOWER release milestone** → warning. That release has not shipped.
 *     Cutting past it strands it, and cutting it afterwards is the reverse-order
 *     tag gate 4 will then refuse — so this is gate 4's failure, seen early
 *     enough to still be free. Legal, though: skipping a version is allowed.
 *   - **In a HIGHER milestone** → silent. It has explicitly deferred itself.
 *     Whether it touches the same code is not something a gate can weigh.
 *   - **No milestone, or one that is not a release tag** → warning, listed by
 *     number. An unassigned PR is NOT automatically part of this release, and a
 *     gate that guessed would block a real release on someone's draft. The
 *     honest answer is to name them and let the releaser decide — the same
 *     shape `untrackedNote` in `release.ts` uses for the same reason. (The PR
 *     gate already blocks the missing milestone on the PR itself, so this is a
 *     reminder, not a second enforcement point.)
 *
 * THE RELEASE PR IS EXEMPT, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING NOW. `exemption` runs
 * first here exactly as it does in gates 1 and 2, so a PR titled
 * `chore: release vX.Y.Z` is skipped. Since `release:prepare` lands the release
 * commit through a pull request, that PR is by definition open while the
 * release is being cut — and on a re-run (`CHANGELOG.md` already documents the
 * version, so the changelog step is skipped and this gate is the only thing
 * still reading GitHub) it would otherwise be a blocking `open-pr-in-release`
 * finding against itself. The signal is the TITLE, not the branch name: the
 * title is what squash-merge turns into the commit subject and what every other
 * gate in this file already reads, and a branch name is a convention nothing
 * verifies. See `RELEASE_COMMIT_RE`.

   *
   * Tests must pass `false`. `main` reads the repo's real `package.json`, so a
   * test driving a fixture tag otherwise paints an invented `::error` and an
   * invented summary block onto a run that is passing — which teaches everyone
   * to ignore the surface a real gate failure arrives on.
