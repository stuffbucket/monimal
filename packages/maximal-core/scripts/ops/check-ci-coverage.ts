/**
 * check-ci-coverage.ts — what `bun run ci:check` runs. Every step of
 * `check:deep` must also run in a required CI job, or it is a red build.
 *
 * WHY: `dupes:check` landed in `check:deep` and in no workflow (#61);
 * `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` sat in the repo, correct and uninvoked, for
 * months. A gate that runs nowhere makes the build green for free.
 *
 * THE EXPECTATION IS DERIVED, NOT RECORDED. Both sides are read from the repo
 * — `check:deep` from package.json, the steps from the workflows — so there is
 * no baseline to bump. `EXCLUDED` is the one hand-written part, and it is a
 * policy like `check-rulesets.ts`'s `EXPECTED`, not a last-reviewed value like
 * `external-drift-baseline.json`: typed, unit-tested, `why` required, and
 * stale entries fail (see below). It holds one entry, `preflight`.
 *
 * "RUNS IN CI" = named by a step of a job that is a REQUIRED status check
 * (`CHECK_JOBS` in check-rulesets.ts), not "appears somewhere in a workflow".
 * A comment is not a step, and a job that is not required — or is path-filtered
 * like tooling-ci.yml's — can be red with the merge button still green.
 * `check:deep` is composite and CI runs its constituents as separate named
 * steps, so composite members are expanded to the scripts CI actually names.
 * The match is on the invocation `bun run <script>` (arguments are not
 * compared); `bun test` is matched as the literal command.
 *
 * ONE DIRECTION ONLY. A CI step that is not in `check:deep` does not fail
 * here. CI legitimately runs what `check:deep` cannot — `bun install`, the
 * Windows artifact leg, `test:ops` — so the reverse assertion would need a
 * second, churnier exclusion list to buy nothing: those steps do run, and are
 * blocking. The hole this closes is a check that runs NOWHERE.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 every member is covered · 1 a member runs in no required job,
 * or `EXCLUDED` is stale · 2 the repo could not be read (a renamed job, an
 * unparseable script).
