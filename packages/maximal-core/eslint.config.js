// The single-mechanism invariant (ADR-0001): a credential token becomes an
// Authorization / x-api-key header in EXACTLY one file, `src/lib/http/send-request.ts`.
// This rule bans hand-attaching a credential anywhere else, so "one mechanism"
// can't silently regress — a new endpoint that tries to attach its own token
// fails CI and is pushed toward sendRequest().
//
// We ban ATTACHMENT (building the auth value, or naming the auth header), not
// token READS: presence guards (`if (!state.copilotToken)`), fallback
// resolution, and lifecycle writes are all legitimate reads and far too
// numerous to allowlist. The leak vector is a request leaving with a
// hand-attached token.
//
// SHAPES COVERED. Each was probed against a fixture of positives and negatives
// and then against the whole of `src/**`, which yields hits in exactly the
// two files listed in `ignores` and nowhere else:
//
//   `Bearer ${t}` / `token ${t}`   template interpolation
//   "Bearer " + t                  string concatenation
//   { Authorization: v }           object literal, identifier key
//   { "x-api-key": v }             object literal, string key
//   headers.set("x-api-key", v)    Headers setter — also .append()
//   headers["x-api-key"] = v       member assignment — also `.authorization =`
//
// Only the first and the fourth used to be covered. The consequence was that
// `send-request.ts` — the reference implementation this rule exists to make
// unique — attaches via `headers.set(...)` (lines 87/94/104/116/118), a shape
// the guard could not see; any other file could have done the same silently.
// The old rule also carried a dead selector, `Property[key.name='x-api-key']`:
// `x-api-key` is not a valid identifier, so that key is always a string
// literal and `key.name` never exists on it.
//
// SHAPES NOT COVERED, and not coverable by a selector. The rule does not claim
// otherwise and neither do its messages, which say "this shape" rather than
// implying the set is closed:
//
//   - a header name held in a variable:      headers.set(name, value)
//   - a name assembled at runtime:           headers.set("x-" + kind, value)
//   - a record built elsewhere and spread:   fetch(url, { headers: authHeaders })
//   - a credential crossing a function boundary as an opaque
//     Record<string, string> / Headers
//
// Deciding those needs the VALUE of an expression, not its shape; ESLint sees
// only shape. Treat this rule as a tripwire on the common forms, not a proof.
//
// Precision note: the object-literal selectors are scoped to
// `ObjectExpression >` on purpose. Without it they also match ObjectPattern,
// so `const { authorization } = headers` — a read — would fail the build, and a
// rule that fires on legitimate code gets suppressed and then enforces nothing.
//
// `ignores` is exhaustive and minimal: with it emptied, the widened rule hits
// those two files and nothing else in `src/**`. Two entries that used to sit
// here were removed because they no longer named a violation — `src/setup.ts`
// (its smoke test now deliberately sends no x-api-key) and `**/*.test.ts`
// (`files` is `src/**/*.ts`, and there are no tests under `src/`).

// Guard the `mock.module()` idiom in tests. Read this before adding a case:
// the rule deliberately does NOT claim to make module mocking safe.
//
// THE MECHANISM (re-measured on Bun 1.3.11, the pin; an earlier revision of this
// comment got it wrong twice and the wrong version is what let #27 ship).
//
// `bun test` INTERLEAVES evaluation and execution — it evaluates one test
// file's module body, runs that file's tests and hooks, then evaluates the next.
// A six-file probe prints `EVAL e → TEST e → AFTERALL e → EVAL f → …`, plain and
// under `--randomize`. So the leak is FORWARD-ONLY (a file evaluated earlier has
// already finished and cannot be affected), and an `afterAll` restore does run
// before the next file is evaluated. The previous claim here — "Bun evaluates
// every test file's module body during startup, so a restore is structurally
// incapable of mattering" — is false and does not reproduce.
//
// What actually breaks a restore is its VALUE, not its timing. `mock.module`
// mutates the live module record IN PLACE, so the namespace object captured with
// `await import(...)` before the install is retroactively updated to hold the
// stub. Restoring from it therefore re-installs the stub:
//
//   const real = await import("./m")
//   await mock.module("./m", () => ({ ...real, TABLE: [] }))  // install: fine
//   await mock.module("./m", () => real)                      // restore: NO-OP
//   await mock.module("./m", () => ({ ...real }))             // restore: NO-OP
//                                                             // (`real` is
//                                                             //  already stubbed)
//
//   const snapshot = { ...(await import("./m")) }   // copy taken BEFORE install
//   await mock.module("./m", () => snapshot)        // restore: WORKS
//
// Measured both directions on the same seed, and in-repo: with the namespace
// form, tests/poll-access-token.test.ts's no-op `sleep` stub reached a later
// sibling on 5 of 12 seeds; with the snapshot form, on 0 of 12. It is NOT that
// `mock.module` refuses a Module Namespace exotic object — installing one works
// fine (probed) — it is that the namespace is live.
//
// This is why rule 4 below exists: the broken shape IS statically detectable.
//
// What is still NOT statically detectable: whether a given `mock.module` call is
// safe. That depends on whether any *other* file evaluated later in the run
// imports the mocked module and when it reads the binding — a property of the
// whole run's module graph, not of the call site. No selector can decide it, and
// the rule does not pretend to. A correct restore is version-dependent hygiene
// (Bun documents no ordering guarantee), never a licence to mock a shared
// module. The durable fix is still a DI seam (`__setServeForTests`,
// `__setBootSecretsForTests`) or using the real module.
//
// What the rule CAN and does enforce, all precision-first:
//
//  1. The fire-and-forget statement forms — `void mock.module(…)` and a bare
//     `mock.module(…)` expression statement. Justification is narrower than it
//     used to be: an unawaited install is not guaranteed to have landed before
//     the same file's next `await import(...)`, so the file can test the real
//     module while believing it tested the stub. It says nothing about leaks.
//
//  2. Stubbing a NON-FUNCTION export with a literal value (array / string /
//     number / boolean / template). PR #27's audit of all 24 `mock.module` sites
//     found every one replaced *function* exports and spread `...real` — except
//     the single site that stubbed a data table (`SECRET_DEFS: []`), and that is
//     the one that caused the outage. The asymmetry is the point: a leaked
//     function stub gets CALLED by the sibling and usually throws or returns an
//     obviously wrong shape, so it fails loudly and near the cause. A leaked
//     empty array is READ silently and yields a plausible wrong answer — here,
//     an empty secrets table made `anthropic-key-precedence` see no
//     `secrets/anthropic` entry. Both leak; only one is quiet.
//
//     Deliberately excluded from the match: object literals. The common shape
//     `default: { ...real.default, unlink: fn }` is a *function* override nested
//     one level down, and four existing sites use it. Flagging object literals
//     would cry wolf on all four, and a rule that cries wolf gets suppressed and
//     then enforces nothing. Precision over coverage — the same bar
//     `tests/docs-reference-parity.test.ts` is held to.
//
//  3. A deny-list of specific modules a sibling is known to read passively, each
//     with a DI seam that replaces the mock. Membership is earned by an incident.
//
//  4. A `mock.module` factory that reads a LIVE module namespace binding
//     (`import * as ns` / `const ns = await import(…)`) — the broken-restore
//     shape above. This one needs scope analysis, not a selector: the *correct*
//     form is also a bare identifier (`() => realRegistry`, where
//     `realRegistry = { ...realRegistryModule }`), so matching on syntax alone
//     would flag every correct restore in the repo and miss the
//     `() => ({ ...ns })` variant, which is broken for the same reason. See
//     `liveNamespaceMockFactory` below.

// Flagged: any identifier read inside a `mock.module` factory whose declaration
