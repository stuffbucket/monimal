 *   ports at it, which is what that engine actually did.

 * Returns `ParsedReadyLine`, **not** `ReadyLine`: the v0 branch reports `v: 0`,
 * which the emitter's `v >= 1` does not admit. Annotating this `ReadyLine` type-
 * checks (`0` is a `number`) and is exactly the lie this signature avoids.
 * Nothing else changes for a caller — normalisation is total, so the ports and
 * pid are usable without narrowing on `v`.
