/**
 * ControlClient — the consumer-side SDK for the /control surface. A UI-server
 * tier or desktop app uses this to read state, drive actions, and stay in sync
 * with the live event stream. Isomorphic (uses `fetch` + ReadableStream, no
 * browser-only APIs), so it runs in a browser, Bun, or Node.
 *
 * Speaks the stateless JSON-RPC 2.0 control plane (ADR-0023): `call()` for
 * request/response, and a `subscriptions/listen` stream for push. Both go to the
 * one `POST /control/rpc` endpoint.
 *
 * A fetch-based SSE reader, NOT native EventSource — the subscription IS a POST
 * (`subscriptions/listen` to the one `/control/rpc` endpoint) and EventSource is
 * GET-only and browser-only, at the cost of re-implementing reconnect/backoff
 * here. It is NOT "so it can send auth headers": this client sends no
 * credential, and the surface it talks to accepts none (see
 * `ControlClientOptions.headers`).
 *
 * State model mirrors the server: a `control/snapshot` notification seeds
 * per-topic state, then `control/<topic>` notifications overwrite by topic.
 * Heartbeat comments are skipped transparently. There is no resume bookkeeping —
 * a dropped feed reconnects and re-snapshots.

     *   returns before a key is ever extracted, so a key sent here is not merely
     *   optional — it is never read. The surface is protected by being
     *   loopback-only (the control router 404s a remote caller itself) on an
     *   ephemeral port, behind an Origin allowlist (ADR-0021).
     * - Credentials that DO leave this project attach in exactly one place,
     *   `src/lib/http/send-request.ts`, which picks the credential from the
     *   destination host so a caller cannot choose the wrong one (ADR-0001). A
     *   credential passed through here would bypass that mechanism entirely, and

     * type for literal spellings, and at construction time by a case-insensitive
