/**
 * Boot-time token-usage retention must not be able to kill the process.
 *
 * `startTokenUsageRetention()` is called from `finalizeBoot` — AFTER both
 * listeners are bound, after `printReadyBanner`, and after the ready-line has
 * been emitted to a supervisor. Its sweep fires `pruneTokenUsageEvents()`, whose
 * first act is to open the SQLite file. `void promise.then(...)` attaches a
 * fulfilment handler only, so a rejection there is an UNHANDLED rejection, and
 * neither Bun nor Node tolerates one by default: the process exits.
 *
 * The trigger is ordinary local-state damage, not exotic input. The store lives
 * at `$APP_DIR/copilot-api.sqlite`; a SIGKILL mid-write, a disk-full, or a
 * restored/synced partial file leaves bytes that SQLite rejects with
 * `SQLITE_NOTADB`, and an installer-owned or read-only file yields
 * `SQLITE_CANTOPEN`. Either way the user sees the proxy announce that it is
 * ready and then die, with a raw SQLite stack and no mention of the database —
 * and a supervisor that already parsed the ready-line sees a healthy start
 * followed by an unexplained exit.
 *
 * Usage bookkeeping is a non-essential side feature. It must degrade to "no
 * retention sweep", never take the proxy with it.
