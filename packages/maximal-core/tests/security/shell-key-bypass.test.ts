/**
 * `decideAuth`'s shell-key arm (`src/lib/auth/request-auth.ts`), the first and
 * highest-priority rule in the documented decision order
 * (`docs/spec/wire/auth-transport-wire-prd.md` -> _The decision_; ADR-0021).
 *
 * A request whose key equals `state.shellApiKey` (`MAXIMAL_SHELL_KEY`, injected
 * by the desktop shell at sidecar spawn) is allowed **regardless of the enforce
 * flag** and without appearing in any configured allow list. It is the one
 * credential that outranks "Block unknown connections", so it is also the one
 * comparison where a widened match is a total authentication bypass rather than
 * a scoped one.
 *
 * Nothing exercised it. The mutation sweep recorded in
 * `docs/dev/testing-strategy.md` §6 found every mutant in `isShellKey` alive,
 * because no test ever set `state.shellApiKey` — with it `undefined`, the
 * function returns `false` for every input and every rewrite of it returns
 * `false` too. `tests/token-route-loopback.test.ts` does set it, but asserts a
 * 404 that a rejected request would also produce, so it observes nothing here
 * either.
 *
 * These drive the real `publicApp` — the real `applyCommonMiddleware` stack and
 * the real `createAuthMiddleware` with no injected `isEnforcing` or
 * `getApiKeys`, so the resolvers that run in production are the ones under test.
