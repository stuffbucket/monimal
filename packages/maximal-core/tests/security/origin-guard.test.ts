/**
 * Control-surface hardening (ADR-0021 §6).
 *
 * The first half of this file unit-tests the two pure predicates and the
 * middleware in isolation. The second half is the **route-enumeration** test
 * ADR-0021 → _Testing_ asked for: it walks the real `routes` tables of both
 * listeners so a control route added outside a guarded prefix fails here rather
 * than shipping unguarded.
 *
 * The version this replaced enumerated nothing. It asserted on `/settings/api`
 * and mounted its own throwaway Hono app on that path — a surface deleted at the
 * core split — so it passed while exercising a route table that did not exist.
 * A route-enumeration test that cannot fail is worse than none: it is what let
 * `/control` be added to `CSRF_GUARDED_PREFIXES` with nothing checking that the
 * guard reached it. Everything below drives `~/server`'s actual apps.
