 * `window.fetch` demands `window` and throws `TypeError: Illegal invocation`

 * rather than an edge (maximal-core#104, found against v0.5.0).
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS IN THIS SHAPE. The receiver rule is browser-only, so no
 * suite running under Bun can observe the failure directly — the whole reason
 * it shipped. Instead of a realm, this asserts the property the browser rule
 * depends on: the stored implementation must NOT be invoked with the client as
 * its receiver. That fails on a bare `fetch` and passes on a bound one, with no
