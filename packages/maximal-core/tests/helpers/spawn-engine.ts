/**
 * Spawn the real `start` engine for an integration test and learn the ports it
 * actually bound.
 *
 * **Why this exists.** The tests that spawn a real server used to guess a port
 * — `4143 + random(100)`, `4243 + random(100)`, `4343 + random(100)` — and
 * derive the control port as `port + 1`. Those windows overlap each other at
 * both seams (a proxy port of 4242 takes 4243 for control, which is the bottom
 * of the next test's window), so two files could pick the same socket in the
 * same run and only in the same run. That is the whole of the flake: it passes
 * in isolation because nothing else is running.
 *
 * Guessing is also unnecessary. `--port 0` / `--control-port 0` asks the OS for
 * ephemeral ports — which by construction cannot collide with anything, in this
 * suite or on the developer's machine — and the engine already publishes what it
 * bound on the ready-line (`src/lib/start/boot-status.ts`). This is the same
 * seam `scripts/dev/harness/sidecar.ts` uses for the e2e harnesses; unit-level
 * integration tests now go through it too instead of a second, weaker mechanism.
 *
 * The ready-line is gated on `MAXIMAL_SIDECAR_PARENT_PID`, so `sidecarSpawnEnv`
 * is not optional — without it the engine emits no marker and this waits out its
 * whole timeout.
 *
 * `awaitReadyLine` is deliberately NOT reused here: it takes ownership of an
 * async iterator over stdout and never releases it, and a `ReadableStream` can
 * only be iterated once. A test needs to keep draining after boot (an undrained
 * pipe fills and blocks the child) *and* keep the lines for failure output, so
 * this owns one loop that does both and reuses the exported `parseReadyLine`.
