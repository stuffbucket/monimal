# Troubleshooting and FAQ

When something isn't working, start here. Most issues come down to one of a few things. Maybe you're not signed in. Maybe a tool is pointed at the wrong place. Or maybe a key changed out from under a long-running session. Below are the fixes for the problems people hit most, plus quick answers to common questions.

If you're just getting started, run through [Install maximal](./install.md) and [Sign in](./connect-copilot.md) first.

## Quick checklist

Before digging in, confirm the basics:

- **maximal is open.** It runs in the background, so even if you don't see a window it may still be running.
- **You're signed in.** Open the **Account** section. It should show a connected GitHub account. Because maximal runs your tools through your own Copilot license, you need an active GitHub Copilot plan.
- **Your tools are switched on.** In the **Apps** section, check that the tool you're using has its switch flipped on. maximal sets those tools up for you. If you wired a tool up by hand, confirm it's still pointed at maximal — the exact values live in the **Endpoint** section.

## "I'm signed in, but my tool gets errors"

If maximal is open and your tool still fails, maximal is probably reaching Copilot but Copilot is rejecting the request.

1. Open **Account** and check the status. It surfaces upstream rejections — billing, plan, rate-limit, or terms issues — with a link to fix them.
2. Confirm your Copilot subscription is active. Without one, maximal still runs, but Copilot rejects every call.
3. If you're on **GitHub Enterprise**, maximal needs to be pointed at your company's Copilot deployment instead of public GitHub. See the [For developers](#for-developers) section below for the setting.
4. Check the **Usage** section for rate-limit quotas. If you're out of quota, requests fail until it resets. See [Usage](./usage-and-settings.md) for how maximal displays quotas.

## My tool suddenly can't authenticate

The auto-generated "Default" key is minted once and persisted, so a restart on
its own does not change it. What *does* invalidate a saved key is the key
entry going away or being disabled — signing out and back in on a fresh config,
deleting the entry in **API clients**, or a config reset.

The fix: create a **stable, named key** in the **API clients** section and use that for anything long-running. A named key is yours to revoke, and nothing else rewrites it. See [API keys](./usage-and-settings.md) for the steps.

## A tool won't connect at all

maximal doesn't set up every tool automatically.

- maximal auto-detects **Claude Code** and **Claude Desktop (Cowork mode)**. Flip their switch in the **Apps** section and maximal wires them up.
- **Codex**, **opencode**, and any other Anthropic- or OpenAI-SDK client you point at maximal yourself. See [Connect your tools](./connect-your-tools.md) for per-tool steps, and the [For developers](#for-developers) section below for the address and key details.
- **Copilot CLI** appears in **Apps** with a coming-soon label — there's no switch yet.

## "Enabling this app was refused"

Turn an app on, and maximal might back off with a warning. That means the app already has its own address or key helper configured, and maximal won't overwrite settings you (or your admin) put there.

To fix it, clear the conflicting setting from that tool's own config, then flip the switch again. The card explains exactly what conflicted.

## Where are the logs?

Open the **Logs** section. maximal keeps daily-rotated, per-handler request logs (7 days by default) and gives you a reveal-folder button and tail hints. It shows the paths for your platform.

For a fuller picture, open the **Diagnostics** section. It shows your effective config and where each secret comes from (env, file, config, or unset — never the values themselves). It also shows your version, git SHA, and branch. That's the best thing to copy when you report an issue.

## Frequently asked questions

**Do I need an API key from Anthropic or OpenAI?**
No. That's the point — maximal runs your tools on the models in your GitHub Copilot plan. No separate keys, no second bill.

**Does signing out of maximal log me out of GitHub?**
No. Signing out or removing an account only forgets maximal's own saved token. maximal leaves your `gh` CLI login and your GitHub browser session untouched.

**Can I use more than one GitHub account?**
Yes. maximal keeps a multi-account registry — add several accounts and quick-switch between them. Switching restarts maximal into the account you picked.

**I have no API keys listed. Is that a problem?**
It's a security note to be aware of: maximal accepts **all** local requests without a client key until enforcement is turned on (`auth.enforce`). Creating a key in **API clients** is not enough on its own — enforcement is the switch. See [API keys](./usage-and-settings.md).

**Which platforms do you support?**
macOS on Apple Silicon and Windows x64 both ship a standalone binary — there is no installer on either. The Homebrew formula is Apple-Silicon-only. There is no Linux build — run from source there. Details in [Install maximal](./install.md).

**Which models can I use?**
Whatever your Copilot plan includes. The **Models** section lists them live, grouped by kind, with a refresh button. See [Models](./usage-and-settings.md).

**Why does it feel rough around the edges?**
maximal is pre-alpha. We've verified it end-to-end against a real enterprise deployment, but expect some sharp corners — and please report what you find.

## Still stuck?

Grab the details from **Diagnostics** (version, branch, secret sources) and the relevant lines from **Logs**, then open an issue. Those two together are usually enough to sort out what's happening fast.

## For developers

### Pointing a tool by hand

Not every tool auto-configures, so Codex, opencode, and other Anthropic- or OpenAI-SDK clients need the address and a key. Grab both from the **Endpoint** section:

- **Anthropic-compatible** base URL: `http://localhost:4141`
- **OpenAI-compatible** base URL: `http://localhost:4141/v1`
- Send your key as `x-api-key` or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.

The canonical local address is `http://localhost:4141`. If that port is already taken, maximal starts on the next free one and says so — always read the exact values from the **Endpoint** section rather than assuming 4141. See [Connect your tools](./connect-your-tools.md) for per-tool steps.

### GitHub Enterprise

The default is public GitHub Copilot, so Enterprise accounts need `COPILOT_API_ENTERPRISE_URL` pointed at your deployment. If that isn't set, maximal reaches public GitHub and Copilot rejects your Enterprise requests.

### Web search says "unavailable"

maximal resolves web-search and web-fetch requests that Copilot doesn't handle natively, and it picks a search backend automatically: an `OLLAMA_API_KEY` if you set one, otherwise Copilot's own server-side search when your plan has a GPT model that supports it, otherwise an in-process fallback. `unavailable` means the selected backend failed a specific call, not that no backend exists. Check **Diagnostics** to see which one is selected.
