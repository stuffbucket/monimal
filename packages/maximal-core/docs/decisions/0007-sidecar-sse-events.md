# Replace shell polling with sidecar-pushed SSE events

## Context

The Tauri shell discovers sidecar state changes by polling. At least
six poll loops exist (auth status, accounts list, gh-cli status, apps
list, active clients, upstream rejection clear). Polling produces:

- **Laggy UI on transitions.** Account switch *"reboots the sidecar
  into it"* (architecture doc §Config and state) — the shell has no
  way to know when reboot is complete other than polling until the
  next status response succeeds.
- **Race conditions in sign-in.** The device-code flow polls; the
  shell polls auth status; the two polls interleave and the shell
  can render "polling" after the controller has already moved to
  "authenticated."
- **Wasted work.** The shell polls every few seconds even when the
  user isn't looking at the Account section.

The codebase already has `src/lib/event-bus.ts` for in-process pub/sub,
and `Hono` (the server framework) supports streaming responses. There
is no shell↔sidecar event channel yet.

## Decision

Add one SSE endpoint, **`GET /settings/api/events`**, that streams
typed events to a single shell subscriber. Event types (initial set):

- `auth.changed` — payload is the full new `AuthStatus`
- `accounts.changed` — payload is the new `AccountsListResponse`
- `apps.changed` — payload is the new `AppsListResponse`
- `clients.changed` — payload is the new `ActiveApiClientsResponse`
- `upstream.rejection` — payload is the new `UpstreamRejection`
- `boot.state` — payload describes sidecar reboot transitions
  (e.g. account-switch reboot complete)

Each event payload is the same shape the corresponding GET endpoint
returns. The shell keeps the GETs for initial fetch on mount and as
a fallback if the SSE connection drops.

Subscribe pattern in the shell:

```ts
const es = new EventSource("/settings/api/events", { withCredentials: false });
es.addEventListener("auth.changed", (e) => renderAccount(JSON.parse(e.data)));
es.addEventListener("accounts.changed", (e) => renderAccounts(JSON.parse(e.data)));
// …
es.onerror = () => /* drop back to single GET; reconnect with backoff */
```

The sidecar publishes via the existing `event-bus.ts`; the SSE route
is a thin adapter that subscribes to the bus and writes events out.

## Alternatives considered

- **WebSockets.** Bidirectional, but the shell never needs to push
  state — it acts via existing POST endpoints. SSE is simpler, one
  connection, browser/Tauri-webview supported natively.
- **Tauri native event channel (`emit`/`listen`).** Couples the
  contract to Tauri; would diverge if anyone ever wanted a
  browser-served settings UI. SSE works in both.
- **Long polling.** Stopgap; ends up reimplementing SSE with worse
  semantics.
- **Keep polling, just reduce intervals.** Doesn't fix races; makes
  laggy worse for batteries.

## Consequences

- The shell removes ~6 polling loops; replaces with one EventSource
  + one initial GET per section on first mount.
- Reboot-on-switch becomes observable: the shell shows a "switching…"
  state until `boot.state` says ready, then auto-renders the new
  account.
- The `last_upstream_rejection` "clears on next successful
  completion" mechanic stops needing a poll to be observed —
  `upstream.rejection` arrives with `null`/cleared marker.
- One new dep on the SSE client side (built-in `EventSource`); no
  new runtime dep on the server side (Hono supports streaming).

## Auth

The SSE endpoint is auth-gated like the rest of `/settings/api/*`.
The shell already passes the API key for those calls — extend the
same approach for `EventSource`, which doesn't natively send custom
headers. Use a query-string token for the SSE endpoint
(`?key=<api_key>`) **only on this endpoint**, validated by the same
middleware. Mark it allowlisted for the query-string path in the
auth middleware, never for any other endpoint. Document the choice
in the route file.

## Migration

1. Add `src/routes/settings/events.ts` and register it in the
   settings router with a streaming-aware Hono handler.
2. Have producers (`auth-controller.ts`, account-switch handler,
   apps reconciler, etc.) publish to `event-bus.ts` after any
   mutation that affects observable state.
3. Add a tiny `subscribeEvents()` helper in `shell/src/api.ts`
   wrapping `EventSource` with typed event payloads (uses ADR-0005
   shared types).
4. Replace each polling loop in `shell/src/main.ts` (and React
   feature hooks) one by one. Keep the GET-on-mount for initial
   render; remove the recurring fetch.
5. Add `tests/events-route.test.ts` covering: event delivery, auth
   gating, reconnect handling.

## Out of scope

- Multi-subscriber fan-out (one shell, one connection). If a CLI
  consumer ever wants events, generalize later.
- Replay / event sourcing. Initial-GET + live-events is enough.

## Open questions

- Heartbeats: send a comment line every 15s to keep proxies from
  closing the connection? Yes — minimal cost, big reliability win.
- Should the `EventSource` be re-established after a sidecar reboot
  during account switch? Yes — the shell will see `onerror`, wait
  briefly, reconnect; the controller emits `boot.state` once the
  sidecar is healthy. Document the reconnect contract.
