# Claude Desktop / Cowork MDM reference

What managed-preferences keys Claude Desktop reads, where they live,
and which ones matter for using this proxy as a third-party inference
gateway.

Last verified: 2026-08-05.

## Why this matters here

Claude Desktop's "Cowork on third-party inference" mode has two
configuration tiers:

1. **UI preferences** in `claude_desktop_config.json`. maximal writes to the
   third-party user-data dir — `~/Library/Application Support/Claude-3p/` on
   macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude-3p\` on Windows (`getClaude3pDir`,
   `src/apps/claude-desktop/config.ts`) — with the profile itself under
   `configLibrary/<uuid>.json` and a `configLibrary/_meta.json` pointer.
   Interactive Claude Desktop uses the un-suffixed `Claude/` dir.
2. **MDM / managed preferences** in the macOS user defaults domain
   `com.anthropic.claudefordesktop` (or Windows `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Claude`)
   — what an admin pushes via Jamf / Kandji / Intune in production.

Several behaviors that look like "broken developer mode" are really
"this knob has no useful default; admins are expected to populate it
via MDM." For solo developer use you can write the same keys directly
with `defaults write` (no MDM needed) and Claude Desktop respects them.

**Precedence (highest first):** server-managed > MDM/OS-level >
file-based managed-settings > Windows registry. The
`claude_desktop_config.json` UI preferences sit below the managed tier.

## Default profile written by `maximal app claude-desktop --enable`

`maximal setup` is client-neutral and **does not configure Claude
Desktop**. To pair Claude Desktop with the proxy, run the opt-in
subcommand:

```sh
maximal app claude-desktop --enable           # write the profile
maximal app claude-desktop --disable          # remove our keys
maximal app claude-desktop --enable --force   # write even if Claude Desktop isn't installed yet
maximal app claude-desktop --enable --managed # emit an MDM .mobileconfig instead
```

The command writes the full "Default" profile that Claude Desktop's
**Configure third-party inference** panel surfaces, not just the three
gateway-wiring keys. The complete set:

```json
{
  "inferenceProvider": "gateway",
  "inferenceGatewayBaseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:4141",
  "inferenceGatewayApiKey": "anything",
  "inferenceGatewayAuthScheme": "bearer",
  "deploymentMode": "3p",
  "disableDeploymentModeChooser": true,
  "isClaudeCodeForDesktopEnabled": true,
  "coworkEgressAllowedHosts": ["*"],
  "allowedWorkspaceFolders": ["$HOME/Claude"],
  "isDesktopExtensionEnabled": true,
  "isDesktopExtensionDirectoryEnabled": true,
  "isDesktopExtensionSignatureRequired": false,
  "isLocalDevMcpEnabled": true,
  "disableAutoUpdates": false,
  "disableEssentialTelemetry": true,
  "disableNonessentialTelemetry": true,
  "disableNonessentialServices": false,
  "preferences": { "coworkWebSearchEnabled": true }
}
```

`allowedWorkspaceFolders` is parameterized to the running user's `$HOME` and
the directory is created on disk if missing.

Two files, two write strategies (`applyConfigLibraryProfile`):

- **`configLibrary/<uuid>.json`** — the profile above is written **wholesale**
  (`atomicWriteJson(profilePath, values)`). It is maximal's own profile entry,
  so there is nothing foreign in it to preserve.
- **`claude_desktop_config.json`** — **merged**. Only `deploymentMode: "3p"` and
  the nested `preferences.coworkWebSearchEnabled: true` are set; every other
  top-level key and every other `preferences` sub-key is preserved verbatim.

`maximal app claude-desktop --disable` (or `maximal uninstall --force`) reverts
via `revertConfigLibraryProfile`, which deletes the profile file, clears
`_meta.json`'s `appliedId`, removes `deploymentMode`, and strips the
`preferences` keys maximal owns.

The owned set is `OWNED_PREFERENCES` in `src/apps/claude-desktop/config.ts` —
today just `coworkWebSearchEnabled`. Apply spreads that object in and revert
strips exactly its keys, so the two cannot drift: adding a preference there
automatically makes revert clean it up. If nothing of the user's own remains,
`preferences` is deleted rather than left as an empty object.

### Why `deploymentMode` is in the profile

Setting `inferenceProvider` plus `disableDeploymentModeChooser` puts the
app in third-party mode and hides the provider chooser, but it does
**not** record a *persisted mode choice*. Claude Desktop's first-run
gate is `readPersistedDeploymentMode() === undefined` — when no
`deploymentMode` has ever been written, the app treats the launch as a
pre-sign-in first run and shows the Claude.ai sign-in screen, even with
the gateway fully wired. The machine that did interactive setup has the
key persisted; a freshly-configured one does not. Writing
`deploymentMode: "3p"` (the exact value the app persists when a user
picks third-party) is what skips the sign-in on a clean install.

### MDM-tier interaction

The wizard owns one egress knob: file-tier `coworkEgressAllowedHosts: ["*"]`.
Because MDM-tier defaults take precedence over the file, an MDM value for
`coworkEgressAllowedHosts` in `com.anthropic.claudefordesktop` — most commonly
populated by Claude Desktop's own installer — **wins over** what maximal writes.

maximal does **not** read or delete that MDM key: nothing in `src/` shells out
to `defaults`, and `CLAUDE_3P_PREF_DOMAIN` is used only to emit the
`.mobileconfig` under `--managed`. If the effective allowlist looks wrong,
check the MDM tier by hand:

```sh
defaults read com.anthropic.claudefordesktop coworkEgressAllowedHosts
defaults delete com.anthropic.claudefordesktop coworkEgressAllowedHosts
```

Run `scripts/install-cowork-egress.sh` for the curated list instead of `*`.

Because revert can only strip the keys maximal wrote, an MDM-tier value that
existed beforehand is not restored. The proposed fix — snapshot the prior state
at apply time and replay it on `uninstall --force` — is spec'd in
[`docs/spec/claude-desktop-config-snapshot.md`](../spec/claude-desktop-config-snapshot.md)
and not yet implemented.

## Key reference (subset relevant to this proxy)

| Key | Type | Default | Controls |
|---|---|---|---|
| `inferenceProvider` | string | unset | `gateway` / `bedrock` / `vertex` / `foundry`. Set via UI when you pick "Gateway" in Configure third-party inference. |
| `deploymentMode` | string (`3p`/`1p`) | unset | **Persisted deployment-mode choice.** Unset = first-run-before-sign-in → the app shows the Claude.ai sign-in screen even with the gateway wired. Write `3p` to skip it. The app persists this itself once a user picks third-party interactively. |
| `inferenceGatewayBaseUrl` | string | unset | Gateway endpoint URL (e.g. `http://localhost:4141`). |
| `inferenceGatewayApiKey` | string | unset | Bearer credential. We accept literal `anything`. |
| `inferenceModels` | JSON array (as string) | unset | Allowlist of model IDs / aliases. Useful to hide variants if our `/v1/models` listing changes. |
| `coworkEgressAllowedHosts` | JSON array | unset (= deny most) | **The egress allowlist that gates Cowork's bundled tool-call traffic.** Accepts exact hostnames (`api.github.com`), single-level wildcards (`*.corp.com`), and the bare sentinel `*` for allow-all. Wildcards don't cover the apex — `*.corp.com` matches `docs.corp.com` but not `corp.com` itself. Scope is **tool calls only** — inference and MCP traffic have their own allowlists. IP literals and `localhost` always resolve regardless of this list. Surfaced in the desktop UI under **Configure third-party inference → Sandbox & workspace → Allowed egress hosts** (with an `* Allow all` button). |
| `coworkWebSearchEnabled` | bool | `true` | (UI-tier preference, not MDM.) Enables Cowork's bundled WebSearch connector. |
| `isLocalDevMcpEnabled` | bool | `true` | Allow user-added local stdio MCP servers via Developer settings. |
| `managedMcpServers` | JSON array | unset | Org-pushed remote MCP servers (HTTP/SSE) — e.g. GitHub MCP, Atlassian MCP. |
| `isDesktopExtensionEnabled` | bool | `true` | Allow installation of `.mcpb` desktop extensions. |
| `allowedWorkspaceFolders` | JSON array | unset | Which absolute paths Cowork can attach as workspace folders. |

## Where to write these on macOS

Three options, by descending durability:

```sh
# 1. User defaults (simplest; survives restarts)
defaults write com.anthropic.claudefordesktop <key> <value>
defaults read  com.anthropic.claudefordesktop                  # inspect

# 2. Managed plist (MDM-style, requires writing a configuration profile)
sudo profiles install -path /path/to/com.anthropic.claudefordesktop.mobileconfig

# 3. Per-deployment file (relevant for fleet management)
# /Library/Managed Preferences/com.anthropic.claudefordesktop.plist
```

Restart Claude Desktop after any change (`Cmd+Q`, then relaunch).

## Practical recipes for this proxy

### Allow Cowork's connectors to navigate to common trustworthy hosts

`coworkEgressAllowedHosts` is the knob that controls Cowork's bundled
WebSearch / fetch egress filter. Three useful shapes:

```sh
# Curated allowlist (what scripts/install-cowork-egress.sh writes —
# ~140 entries spanning code hosting, package registries, language
# docs, standards bodies, news outlets, search engines, AI labs,
# cloud provider docs, and testing domains).
bash scripts/install-cowork-egress.sh

# Allow-all (single sentinel — Cowork's matcher honors bare "*").
defaults write com.anthropic.claudefordesktop coworkEgressAllowedHosts -array "*"

# Remove the key entirely (defaults to "deny most" again).
defaults delete com.anthropic.claudefordesktop coworkEgressAllowedHosts
```

Empty (or unset) is **not** the same as `*` — it's an allowlist, so
"unset" denies most hosts. `*` is the only way to switch off host
gating without disabling the connector. Cowork's UI surfaces this as
the `* Allow all` button under **Configure third-party inference →
Sandbox & workspace → Allowed egress hosts**.

With our proxy doing the actual web fetching (via whichever executor
`chooseExecutor` selects — Ollama, Copilot `/responses`, or the in-process
fallback), the curated allowlist is optional — Cowork's
bundled connectors aren't on the proxy's path for `web_search` (the
model emits a server-tool block, our proxy intercepts, the executor
runs it). But for `web_fetch` and other URL-grabbing connectors that
run inside the desktop process, the allowlist still gates them.

### Hide variant model IDs from the picker

We already drop `-high`, `-xhigh`, `-1m`, `-1m-internal` variants in our
`/v1/models` listing (`src/routes/models/route.ts`). If you want
belt-and-suspenders enforcement, also set:

```sh
defaults write com.anthropic.claudefordesktop inferenceModels \
  -string '["claude-opus-4-7-20260301","claude-opus-4-6-20260301","claude-haiku-4-5-20260301","claude-sonnet-4-6-20260301"]'
```

That restricts the picker to exactly the IDs you list, regardless of
what the gateway returns.

### Disable WebSearch connector (alternative to egress allowlist)

If you want the proxy to be the sole web-tools path (no Cowork-side
connectors competing), this has to be turned **off by hand** — note that
`--enable` sets it to `true` (it is in `OWNED_PREFERENCES`), so it comes
back on the next enable and a `--disable` strips the key rather than
setting it to `false`:

```sh
# (lives in claude_desktop_config.json, not the MDM domain)
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
# then set "preferences": { "coworkWebSearchEnabled": false }
```

## What developer-mode users typically need to set

| Goal | Where | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Point at the local proxy | UI: Configure third-party inference | already done |
| Skip the login chooser | `disableDeploymentModeChooser = true` | hides the chooser |
| Skip the Claude.ai sign-in on a fresh machine | `deploymentMode = "3p"` | persists the third-party choice (see above) |
| Cowork bundled connectors reach common trustworthy hosts | `coworkEgressAllowedHosts` | see `scripts/install-cowork-egress.sh` |
| Cowork bundled connectors reach **any** host (turn host gating off) | `coworkEgressAllowedHosts` | `["*"]` (bare `*` is the allow-all sentinel) |
| Avoid duplicate variant ids in picker | proxy-side, already shipped | n/a |
| Local stdio MCP servers visible | `isLocalDevMcpEnabled = true` | usually default |
