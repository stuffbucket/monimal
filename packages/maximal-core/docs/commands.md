# Commands

Every script below is defined in `package.json`.

```sh
bun install          # Install dependencies
bun run dev          # Dev mode with watch
bun run build        # Bundle src/main.ts to dist/ (refuses off `.bun-version`)
bun run build:lib    # Library build of the consumer exports (tsup -> dist/lib)
bun run start        # Production start (NODE_ENV=production)

# Lint / type / test
bun run lint         # ESLint with cache (auto-fixes staged files pre-commit)
bun run lint:all     # ESLint on entire project
bun run lint:fast    # oxlint — mechanical pass, ~10ms full repo
bun run typecheck    # tsc type check only (no emit)
bun run typecheck:downstream  # compile the downstream/ consumer against the exports map
bun run casts:check  # fail on a new unannotated boundary cast (scripts/find-casts.ts)
bun run bindings:check  # committed dist/lib + dist/main.js vs a fresh build.
                     # Off-pin Bun → "could not verify" (exit 2), never "stale".
bun test             # Run all tests
bun test tests/foo.test.ts  # Run a single test file

# Aggregates
bun run check:fast   # lint:fast + typecheck + lint:all (the per-edit inner loop)
bun run check:deep   # preflight + check:fast + casts:check + bun test + knip +
                     # deps:check + dupes:check + ci:check + build +
                     # typecheck:downstream + bindings:check (end-of-task gate;
                     # every step of it also runs in a required CI job — that is
                     # what ci:check asserts, `preflight` excepted and recorded)
bun run preflight    # fail if node_modules is missing, before any check that
                     # would blame something else for it (scripts/preflight.ts).
                     # Only checks that node_modules exists — not that the
                     # install is complete or current. Never installs for you.
bun run deps:check   # dependency-cruiser (scripts/check-deps.ts). All three
                     # `error` rules fail the build. `not-to-test` and
                     # `no-route-imports-from-lib-or-services` are absolute;
                     # `no-circular` is ratcheted against the set of imports
                     # that close a cycle, recorded in scripts/check-deps.ts.
                     # A new one fails and is named; fixing one also fails,
                     # until you re-record it. The recorded set is the only
                     # statement of how many cycles there are — no count is
                     # written down anywhere else, here included.
bun run deps:check --list    # the standing cycles, grouped by component
bun run deps:check --update  # re-record after fixing cycles (refuses to add)
bun run knip         # find unused exports/files

# Secret scanning
bun run scan:secrets # manual full-repo trufflehog scan. Requires trufflehog on
                     # PATH (`brew install trufflehog`). Honors .trufflehog-exclude
                     # — which NOTHING else reads: CI runs the trufflehog action
                     # over the PR diff, and the pre-commit hook scans only staged
                     # paths. Excluding a path here does not exclude it there.

# End-to-end (spawns the real binary + a real port; outside `bun test`)
bun run e2e          # e2e:seam + e2e:feed + e2e:lifecycle + e2e:replace
MAXIMAL_E2E_BINARY=<path> bun run e2e
                     # the same four harnesses against a compiled binary. Core
                     # builds none — stuffbucket/maximal compiles this repo's
                     # src/main.ts — so point it at that artifact.

# Mutation testing (manual only — not wired into check:deep)
bun run mutate       # Stryker over the module(s) in stryker.conf.json's `mutate`
bunx stryker run --mutate 'src/routes/messages/utils.ts' --concurrency 10
                     # narrow the SOURCE scope per run instead of editing the file.
                     # Budget ~2-2.5s per mutant; a 400-line module is ~20 min.
                     # Do NOT narrow the test command — see testing-strategy.md §6.
bun run test:mutation  # the suite Stryker runs: everything except the six
                     # port-binding/process-spawning files, which false-kill
                     # mutants under Stryker's concurrent workers.

# Release tooling
bun run release:check pr <n>              # scripts/ops/release-gates.ts — one PR's
bun run release:check milestone vX.Y.Z    # title + milestone, or the whole
bun run release:check version vX.Y.Z      # milestone, or tag vs package.json.
                                          # A subcommand is required; bare prints usage.
bun run release:notes v0.2.1  # milestone -> CHANGELOG-shaped Markdown
                              # --release-body for a GitHub Release body
bun run release:prepare vX.Y.Z # phase A. Refuses (exit 1, nothing written) on a
                               # missing tag, a dirty tree, an off-pin Bun, a tag
                               # that is not above every tag that exists, an open PR
                               # in the milestone, or a milestone release:notes would
                               # not emit for; then bumps, rebuilds dist/ on the
                               # pinned Bun, writes the CHANGELOG entry, commits all
                               # three on release/vX.Y.Z, pushes the branch and opens
                               # the PR. CUTS NO TAG.
bun run release:tag vX.Y.Z     # phase B, after that PR merges. Fetches main, refuses
                               # unless the merged package.json is X.Y.Z and this
                               # checkout is that commit with a clean tree, re-runs
                               # the tag-order gate, then cuts the annotated tag on
                               # the merged head and pushes it. That fires
                               # release-tag-check.yml and publish-package.yml.
bun run release:prepare vX.Y.Z --no-publish   # accepted, does nothing
bun run release:preflight     # assert the pinned Bun without cutting anything

# Ops tooling under scripts/ops/ (own tsconfig + test run)

bun run ci:check     # every step of check:deep also runs in a job that is a
                     # REQUIRED status check (scripts/ops/check-ci-coverage.ts).
                     # A check wired into check:deep and into no workflow — the
                     # shape dupes:check and .dependency-cruiser.cjs both had —
                     # fails here by name. Offline; it is in check:deep and in
                     # ci.yml. Deliberate exclusions live in that file, each

bun run rules:check  # the live branch rulesets on `main` vs the floor recorded
                     # in scripts/ops/check-rulesets.ts. Needs the network, so it

bun run container:build  # build maximal-core-ci:bun-<.bun-version>. The tag IS
                         # the pin, so a stale image is not addressable.
bun run container:run -- <cmd>  # run <cmd> against this tree inside it. Builds
                         # on first use. Its own node_modules volume (never the
                         # host's — platform-specific binaries) and your uid,
                         # not root. `-- bun run check:deep` is the usual one.
bun run container:shell  # interactive bash in the same environment
```

`bun run typecheck` (root `tsc`) covers `src/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`,
`eslint.config.js`, `tsup.config.ts` and `downstream/check.ts`. `scripts/ops/` is
additionally covered by `typecheck:ops`, which is what tooling-ci.yml runs.
Note that ESLint ignores `scripts/**` entirely (see `eslint.config.js`), so those
files are type-checked but only oxlint-linted.

Core is headless — there is no `shell/`, no desktop-shell build, and no UI bundle to
watch. `bun run dev -- start --port 4141` runs the proxy from source.
