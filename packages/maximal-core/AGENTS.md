# AGENTS.md

`maximal-core` is a **headless** local proxy that exposes GitHub Copilot as
OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible HTTP endpoints. Bun + Hono + TypeScript.
There is **no UI, no `shell/`, no frontend build** in this repo — a separate
tier drives the engine over the loopback `/control` JSON-RPC 2.0 surface.

## Every turn

- **`bun run check:fast` after each edit** — oxlint + `tsc` + ESLint. This is
  the inner loop.
- **`bun run check:deep` before you call the task done** — adds `casts:check`,
  `bun test`, knip, `deps:check`, `dupes:check`, the build,
  `typecheck:downstream`, and `bindings:check`. It is a superset of CI's `test`
  job, so green here means green there. It does **not** cover `ci.yml`'s
  `windows` job, which runs `bun install` (the `prepare` lifecycle script under
  Bun's Windows shell) and `bun test` on a Windows runner. If you touched
  `scripts/ops/`, also run `bun run check:ops`.
- Single test file: `bun test tests/foo.test.ts`. Tests live in `tests/` as
  `*.test.ts` on Bun's built-in runner.
- **`bun run e2e` if you changed the control plane, the ready-line, or
  shutdown.** Spawns the engine from source and drives the real socket —
  outside `bun test` because it costs seconds and a port. Every bug it has
  caught was invisible to the unit suite. `MAXIMAL_E2E_BINARY=<path> bun run e2e`
  re-runs the same seams against a compiled binary — core builds none, but
  `stuffbucket/maximal` compiles this repo's `src/main.ts` and that is what
  ships.
- Never report success on a command you did not run. If a check fails, say so
  and show the output.

## Writing code

- Import through the `~/` alias for `src/` (`~/lib/errors/error`), never a deep
  relative path.
- Strict TS: no `any`, no unused locals or parameters.
- `verbatimModuleSyntax` + `erasableSyntaxOnly` are on — type-only imports must
  be `import type`, and enums, namespaces, and parameter properties will not
  compile.
- ESM only, no CommonJS. `camelCase` values, `PascalCase` types.
- Route handlers catch and call `forwardError(c, error)`; throw `HTTPError`
  from `~/lib/errors/error`.
- Every API flow supports streaming (SSE via `streamSSE`) and non-streaming,
  switching on `payload.stream`. Implement both.

## Rules that cost a turn when broken

Each rule states the prohibition; the linked doc is its only elaboration.

- **Never `git stash pop` in a shared working tree.** It merges another
  in-flight agent's stash into yours. Isolate first —
  [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) → _Parallel-agent convention_.
- **Do not `mock.module` a shared module — inject instead.** The stub reaches
  every file evaluated *after* the installing one (`bun test` interleaves
  evaluation and execution, so the leak is forward-only). An `afterAll` restore
  does run before the next file evaluates — but only works if it hands back a
  copy captured *before* the install: `mock.module` mutates the live namespace in
  place, so `() => realModule` re-installs the stub. Capture
  `const real = { ...(await import("…")) }`. That missing spread was the whole of
  #27. Prefer a DI seam (`__setServeForTests`, `__setBootSecretsForTests`);
  `mockModuleLeakGuard` catches only some shapes —
  [`docs/dev/testing-strategy.md`](docs/dev/testing-strategy.md) §5.1.
- **Reset module-level state in BOTH `beforeEach` and `afterEach`.** A singleton
  reset only on the way in leaks to the next file; only on the way out inherits
  from the previous one. Both bugs shipped here — §5.6.
- **A PR title must be a single valid Conventional Commit.** Squash-merge uses
  it as the commit subject, and the release notes are generated from PR titles,
  so the title is the only thing that reaches the changelog. Mark a breaking
  change with `!` — that is what puts it in a minor rather than a patch, and a
  breaking change shipped as a patch lands inside a consumer's `^0.y.z` range.
  [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) → _Release & PR conventions_.
- **Assign every PR to a release milestone.** The milestone title is the tag
  that will be cut; it is how a PR pre-selects the release it ships in.
- **`main` requires a PR, three green checks, and an up-to-date branch.** `test`
  and `windows` (`ci.yml`) plus `gate` (`release-gates.yml`) are *required*
  status checks — a red one blocks the merge button, and so does a branch that
  has fallen behind `main` (`gh pr update-branch`; nothing rebases for you
  here). Direct pushes to `main` are rejected, and `main` cannot be deleted or
  force-pushed by anyone. There is **no exemption and no bypass actor**, the
  release included: `release:prepare` lands the release commit through a PR and
  `release:tag` cuts the tag on the merged head afterwards.
