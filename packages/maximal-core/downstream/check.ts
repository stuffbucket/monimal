/**
 * Downstream contract typecheck (maximal-core#4).
 *
 * Acceptance criterion: "A build test proves a downstream package typechecks
 * against the contract without compiling the sidecar."
 *
 * What this does, and why each step is there:
 *
 * 1. **Rebuilds `dist/lib` with tsup.** The committed `dist/lib/*.d.ts` exist so
 *    a git-dependency install gets types without a build step — they are a
 *    convenience copy, and a copy can be stale. What actually ships is whatever
 *    `prepack` (`bun run build:lib`) produces, so that is what has to be under
 *    test; checking the committed copy would green-light bindings nobody will
 *    publish and would fail for reasons unrelated to the contract whenever the
 *    copy lags. Staleness of the committed copy is a SEPARATE gate and is not
 *    this script's job. Pass `--no-build` to skip (e.g. right after a build).
 *
 * 2. **Links the repo into `downstream/node_modules/` under its published name.**
 *    Resolution then goes package-name → `exports` map → `dist/lib/*.d.ts`,
 *    exactly as it does for a consumer. A tsconfig `paths` shortcut would have
 *    been simpler and would have tested nothing: it bypasses the map.
 *
 * 3. **Runs `tsc --noEmit` under two resolvers** (Bundler and NodeNext) over the
 *    fixture sources.
 *
 * 4. **Asserts the resulting program touched no engine source.** "Without
 *    compiling the sidecar" is the load-bearing half of the criterion: a fixture
 *    that passes only because it dragged in `src/` has proven nothing. The
 *    `@ts-expect-error`s in `src/no-src-reach.ts` assert this from the inside;
 *    `--listFiles` asserts it from the outside, where no comment can lie.
 *
 * Run: `bun downstream/check.ts` (from the repo root, or anywhere — paths are
 * resolved relative to this file).
